SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  &  NOTES : 
A
Basis Of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements of
the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in India
(Indian GAAP) to comply with the Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with Rule 7 of
the companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the relevant provisions of
the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”). The financial statements
have been prepared on accrual basis under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of
the
financial statements are consistent with those followed in the previous year.
All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria
set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets
for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents,
the Company ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the
purpose of current and non-current classification of assets and liabilities.
B
Use Of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Indian GAAP requires the management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at
the end of
the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the management’s best knowledge of current events and
actions, uncertainty about
these assumptions and estimates
could result
in the outcomes
requiring a material adjustment
to the
carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods.
C
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term investments
with an original maturity of three months or less.
D
Taxes on Income:
Tax expense comprises
current and deferred tax. Current
income tax is measured at
the amount expected to be paid to the tax
authorities in accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961 enacted in India and tax laws prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions
where the company operates. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively
enacted, at the reporting date.
Deferred Income taxes reflect the impact of timing differences between taxable income and accounting Income originating during the
current year and reversal of
timing differences for the earlier years. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and the tax laws
enacted or
substantively
enacted at
the
reporting date. Deferred income
tax relating to items
recognized directly in equity is
recognized in equity and not in the statement of profit and loss.
Deferred tax
liabilities
are
recognized for
taxable
timing differences. Deferred tax
assets
are
recognized for deductible
timing
differences only to the extent
that
there is reasonable certainty that sufficient
future taxable income will be available against which
such deferred tax assets can be realized. In situations where the company
has unabsorbed depreciation or carry
forward tax
losses,
all deferred tax
assets
are
recognized only if
there
is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that they can be realized
against future taxable profits.
At
each reporting date,
the
company re-assesses unrecognized deferred tax
assets.
It recognizes unrecognized deferred tax asset
to the extent that it has become reasonably certain or virtually certain as the case may be that sufficient future taxable income will be
available against which such deferred tax assets can be realized.
The carrying amount
of deferred tax
assets
are
reviewed at
each reporting date. The company writes-down the carrying amount
of deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer
reasonably certain or virtually certain as
the
case may be
that sufficient future
taxable income will be available against which deferred tax asset can be realized. Any such write-down is reversed to the extent that it
becomes reasonably certain or virtually certain as the case may be that sufficient future taxable income will be available.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set-off
current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority."
