analysis is presented in a separate section forming part of the Annual Report as “Annexure-D”.  

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE: 

The  Company  being  listed  on  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Platform  (BSE  SME  STARTUP 
PLATFORM)  is  exempted  from  provisions  of  corporate  governance  as  per  Regulation  15  of 
Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (Listing  Obligation  and  Disclosure  Requirements) 
Regulation, 2015. Hence no corporate governance report is disclosed in this Annual Report. 

TRANSFER OF AMOUNTS TO INVESTOR EDUCATION AND PROTECTION FUND: 

The  Company  did  not  have  any  funds  lying  unpaid  or  unclaimed  for  a  period  of  seven  years. 
Therefore  there  were  no  funds  which  were  required  to  be  transferred  to  Investor  Education  and 
Protection Fund (IEPF). 

COMPLIANCE WITH SECRETARIAL STANDARDS 

The  Company  has  devised  proper  systems  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  all

Company’s policy requires the conduct of all operations in such manner so as to ensure safety of 
all concerned, compliance of statutory and industrial requirements for environment protection and 
conservation of natural resources to the extent possible. 

DIFFERENCE IN VALUATION: 

During the period under review, the Company has never made any one-time settlement against the 
loans obtain from banks and financial institution and hence this clause is not applicable.

IT Industry Overview 

The  IT  &  BPM  sector  has  become  one  of  the  most  significant  growth  catalysts  for  the  Indian 
economy, contributing significantly to the country’s GDP and public welfare. 
India's IT sector witnessed a 16% YoY growth in hiring in April, driven by factors such as artificial 
intelligence  (AI)  adoption,  cloud  modernisation,  and  the  expansion  of  Global  Capability  Centers 
(GCCs). 
India’s  first  made-in-India  graphics  processing  units  (GPUs)  are  expected  to  be  ready  for 
technology demonstrations by the end of 2025. Production readiness is projected for 2029 under 
the Rs. 10,372 crore (US$ 1.21 billion) IndiaAI Mission. 
As innovative digital applications permeate sector after sector, India is now prepared for the next 
phase of growth in its IT revolution. India is viewed by the rest of the world as having one of the 

38 

 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
THE ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25     

largest  Internet  user  bases  and  the  cheapest  Internet  rates,  with  76  crore  citizens  now  having 
access to the Internet. 

The current emphasis is on the production of significant economic value and citizen empowerment, 
thanks to a solid foundation of digital infrastructure and enhanced digital access provided by the 
Digital  India  Programme.  India  is  one  of  the  countries  with the  quickest  pace of  digital  adoption. 
This  was  accomplished  through  a  mix  of  government  action,  commercial  innovation  and 
investment,  and  new  digital  applications  that  are  already  improving  and  permeating  a  variety  of 
activities and different forms of work, thus having a positive impact on the daily lives of citizens. 
India’s  rankings  improved  six  places  to  the  39th  position  in  the  2024  edition  of  the  Global 
Innovation Index (GII). 
The  outperformance  may  be  attributed  to  market  share  gains  resulting  from  TCS’  strategy  on 
customer  centricity,  its  agile  organization  structure,  and  a  very  stable  leadership  team;  its 
investments  in  organic  talent  development,  research  and  innovation,  intellectual  property,  brand 
building, and in building newer capabilities that have helped expand wallet share with clients; and 
better execution resulting in greater customer satisfaction.

misstatement  therein,  we  are  required  to  communicate  the  matter  to  those  charged  with  governance  and

THE ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25     

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies 
Act,  2013  (“the  Act”)  with  respect  to  the  preparation  and  presentation  of  these  Financial  Statements  that 
give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the company in 
accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards 
specified under Section 133 of the Act, read with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014. 

This  responsibility  also  includes  maintenance  of  adequate  accounting  records  in  accordance  with  the 
provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the company and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and  other  irregularities;  selection  and  application  of  appropriate  accounting  policies;  making  judgments 
and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate 
internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements that give a true 
and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

In  preparing  the  Financial  Statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company’s  ability  to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going 
concern  basis  of  accounting  unless  management  either  intends  to  liquidate  the  Company  or  to  cease 
operations,  or  has  no  realistic  alternative  but  to  do  so.  Those  Board  of  Directors  are  also  responsible  for 
overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. 

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY 

Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  Financial  Statements  as  a  whole  are 
free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditor’s  report  that 
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements 
can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could 
reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  Financial 
Statements. 

We have taken into account the provisions of the Act, the accounting and auditing standards and matters 
which are required to be included in the audit report under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made 
thereunder. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of 
the Act. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in 
the  Financial  Statements.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the  Auditor’s  judgment,  including  the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal financial control relevant to the company’s 
preparation of the Financial Statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures 

50 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that  are  appropriate  in  the  circumstances.  An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  the 
accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  the  accounting  estimates  made  by  the  Company’s 
Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Financial Statements.

THE ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25     

REPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB-SECTION 3 
OF SECTION 143 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 (“THE ACT”)  

We  have  audited  the  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  of  NIKS  TECHNOLOGY 
LIMITED  (“the  Company”)  as  of  31st  March,  2025  in  conjunction  with  our  audit  of  the  Financial 
Statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.  

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS  

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls 
based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the company considering the 
essential  components  of  internal  control  stated  in  the  Guidance  Note  on  audit  of  Internal  Financial 
Controls  over  Financial  Reporting  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  (‘ICAI’). 
These  responsibilities  include  the  design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal 
financial  controls  that  were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  orderly  and  efficient  conduct  of  its 
business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely 
preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.  

AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITY  

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  company's  internal  financial  controls  over  financial 
reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit 
of  Internal  Financial  Controls  over  Financial  Reporting  (the  “Guidance  Note”)  and  the  Standards  on 
Auditing,  issued  by  ICAI  and  deemed  to  be  prescribed  under  section  143(10)  of  the  Companies  Act, 
2013,  to  the  extent  applicable  to  an  audit  of  internal  financial  controls,  both  applicable  to  an  audit  of 
Internal  Financial  Controls  and,  both  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India.  Those 
Standards  and  the  Guidance  Note  require  that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements  and  plan  and 
perform  the  audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal  financial  controls 
over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all 
material respects. 

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal 
financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal 
financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial 
controls  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and 
evaluating  the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk.  The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion on the company’s internal financial controls with reference to Financial Statements.

MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

THE ANNUAL REPORT 2024-25     

A  company's  internal  financial  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide 
reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  Financial 
Statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A 
company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 
(1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the 
transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Financial Statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being 
made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, 
or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the Financial Statements. 

INHERENT  LIMITATIONS  OF  INTERNAL  FINANCIAL  CONTROLS  OVER  FINANCIAL 
REPORTING  

Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting,  including the 
possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management  override  of  controls,  material  misstatements  due  to 
errors  or  frauds  may  occur  and  not  be  detected.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of  the  internal 
financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  the  internal 
financial  control  over  financial  reporting  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

OPINION  

In our opinion, the company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system 
over  financial  reporting  and  such  internal  financial  controls  over  financial  reporting  were  operating 
effectively  as  at  31st  March,  2025,  based  on  the  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  criteria 
established  by  the  company  considering  the  essential  components  of  internal  control  stated  in  the 
Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute 
of Chartered Accountants of India.

NOTES TO AND FORMING PART OF BALANCE SHEET AND STATEMENT OF PROFIT AND LOSS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31ST MARCH 2025

CORPORATE INFORMATION
NIKS TECHNOLOGY LIMITED (the Company) is a Limited company domiciled in India and incorporated under the provisions of

the Companies Act, 2013. The company is engaged in software development and providing education services and Trading in Drone

and Drone parts and Providing related services .

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  &  NOTES : 

Basis Of Preparation of Financial Statements
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in India
(Indian GAAP) to comply with the Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with Rule 7 of
the companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”). The financial statements
have been prepared on accrual basis under the historical cost convention. The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the
financial statements are consistent with those followed in the previous year.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria
set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013. Based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets
for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents, the Company ascertained its operating cycle as 12 months for the
purpose of current and non-current classification of assets and liabilities.

Use Of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Indian GAAP requires the management to make judgments, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at
the end of the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on the management’s best knowledge of current events and
actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the
carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods.

Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term investments
with an original maturity of three months or less.

Taxes on Income:
Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current income tax is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax
authorities in accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961 enacted in India and tax laws prevailing in the respective tax jurisdictions
where the company operates. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively
enacted, at the reporting date.
Deferred Income taxes reflect the impact of timing differences between taxable income and accounting Income originating during the
current year and reversal of timing differences for the earlier years. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates and the tax laws
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred income tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is
recognized in equity and not in the statement of profit and loss.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible timing
differences only to the extent that there is reasonable certainty that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which
such deferred tax assets can be realized. In situations where the company has unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward tax losses,
all deferred tax assets are recognized only if there is virtual certainty supported by convincing evidence that they can be realized
against future taxable profits.
At each reporting date, the company re-assesses unrecognized deferred tax assets. It recognizes unrecognized deferred tax asset
to the extent that it has become reasonably certain or virtually certain as the case may be that sufficient future taxable income will be
available against which such deferred tax assets can be realized.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. The company writes-down the carrying amount
of deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer reasonably certain or virtually certain as the case may be that sufficient future
taxable income will be available against which deferred tax asset can be realized. Any such write-down is reversed to the extent that it
becomes reasonably certain or virtually certain as the case may be that sufficient future taxable income will be available.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set-off current tax assets against current
tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
