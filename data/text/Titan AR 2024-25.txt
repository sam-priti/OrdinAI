MR. RATAN N TATA
28.12.1937 – 09.10.2024

It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata, a truly uncommon 

leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not only the Tata Group but also the very 

fabric of our nation. 

For the Tata Group, Mr. Tata was more than a chairperson. He inspired by example. With an 

unwavering commitment to excellence, integrity and innovation, the Tata Group under his 

stewardship expanded its global footprint while always remaining true to its moral compass. 

Mr. Tata’s dedication to philanthropy and the development of society has touched the lives of millions. 

From education to healthcare, his initiatives have left a deep-rooted mark that will benefit generations 

to come. Reinforcing all of this mark was Mr. Tata’s genuine humility in every individual interaction. 

His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles  

he so passionately championed.

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDThe Future We Embrace

Progress at Titan has never been just about scale or numbers. It is about 
moving forward with intention, led by purpose, shaped by people, and 
anchored in responsibility. Pragati is the name we give to this forward 
motion. It brings together everything we believe in: care for the planet, 
inclusive growth, and transparent, ethical governance.

This isn’t a new direction, rather, it is a continuation with greater clarity. For years, 

we have invested in communities, protected craft legacies, built zero-discharge 

facilities, and created workplaces where inclusion is not an afterthought, but a 

principle. With Pragati, these efforts come together as a unified, long-term vision.

We have set clear goals till the Financial Year 2029-30, backed by a roadmap that 

turns ambition into action. From small, everyday choices to large-scale interventions, 

from what we make to how we make it, Pragati draws strength from the way 

sustainability is lived across Titan.

The Pragati logo featuring a woman, a droplet, and a 
leaf that doubles into a path that embodies Titan's 
vision for inclusive and sustainable progress.

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDIn a free enterprise, the community is not 
just another stakeholder in business, but 
is in fact the very purpose of its existence.

Jamsetji Tata

It’s a matter of great pride for all of us 
that Titan Company crossed a revenue 
of ` 50,000 crore during Financial 
Year 2024-25, within 40 years of its 
commencing operations. My heartfelt 
thanks to all of customers, employees, 
retail and supply chain partners and 
everyone else who works for Titan 
in some way or the other. My thanks 
also to all our shareholders for giving 
us continuous encouragement.

Now, let me move to the theme of 
this year’s annual report.

The term ESG was first introduced 
in a UN report in 2004, exactly 100 
years after Jamsetji’s passing in 1904. 
It boggles the mind to think that such 
visionary thinking about stakeholders 
could exist in the thick of the second 
industrial revolution, way back in the 
late 19th century!

But that is the hoary Tata tradition in 
which Titan Company was schooled 
in the mid-eighties.

That’s the inspiration that made the 
founders of Titan go to villages in 
Tamil Nadu and recruit young women 
and men and train them in making 
watches, rather than hire experienced 
watch-makers from the industry.

Or enable women’s self-help groups 
set up downstream watch assembly 
units, create employment, deliver 
steady incomes and accelerate social 
development.

Or build an organisational culture 
that was anchored in a total belief in 

employees, their innovation potential 
and their commitment to results.

Or build a climate of the highest ethical 
standards over decades, culminating in 
the naming of Titan’s corporate office 
campus as “Integrity.”

These foundational principles 
have created and strengthened 
the stakeholder focus among the 
Company’s leaders and managers, 
resulting in multiple programmes over 
the last 4 decades.

Through formal and informal processes, 
we make sure we listen to our franchise 
and distribution partners and all the 
store staff who work for the Company 
and keep delivering improvements all 
the time.

Through programmes like 4P (People, 
Place, Process, Planet) jewellery vendor 
situations have been transformed 
over the last 2 decades, providing an 
inspiring North Star for the industry. 
The TSEP (Titan Supplier Engagement 
Protocol) seeks to achieve a similar 
thing for vendors who cut and polish 
the diamonds we use.

While Titan always had given the 
subject importance, the Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion (DEI) thrust has been 
strengthened in the last few years, 
providing an equitable environment for 
under-represented groups.

Titan’s corporate governance standards 
have always been very high and this 
was recognised in 2021 when we 
received the first ever Best Board 
Award by ET/Amrop.

Our CSR efforts have been around from 
Day 1 and today they cover a wide 
array of activities including girl child 
education, skilling, support of the art 
and crafts, providing eyecare support 
to the elderly, rejuvenation of lakes, 
building of check dams, providing 
integrated village development work in 
hilly areas, and so on.

Today all these and more have come 
under the strategic Pragati programme 
which seeks to help Titan play out its 
responsibilities to the Planet as well as 
the People, by broadening the scope of 
activities, strengthening the governance 
processes, and investing more than 
what regulation requires.

Through the Pragati programme, the 
Company will strengthen its thrust 
towards

   Net zero carbon
   Reducing fresh water consumption
   Afforestation
   Partner responsibility
   DEI
   Community responsibility
   Ethics and governance

Becoming, over the next few years, an 
even stronger flag-bearer of the Tata 
legacy.

And live up to the dream of Jamsetji 
Tata.

This annual report brings alive many of 
these in a vivid manner.

Senthil Kumar Murugan

He is the founder of Biotasoil, a long-time 
partner whose commitment to ecological 
restoration has helped Titan scale its 
efforts in carbon sequestration.

Tell us about partnering with Titan?

  Titan has always encouraged employees and their families to 

plant saplings, sharing a heartfelt love for nature. But many 

of these little trees struggled to thrive. We knew we needed a 

better way to make a lasting impact. That’s when we created 

a Miyawaki forest at Titan Time Park, Hosur, a dense, native 

forest that grows on its own nurtured by care and a deep 

environmental commitment.

What impact has this project made?

  Today, over 4,500 trees breathe life into Titan Time Park. In just 

three years, the air feels fresher, the days cooler, and the joyful 

return of birds and butterflies fills the park with life. This forest 

is a living promise. A place where nature heals, communities 

find calm, and hope quietly takes root for a greener tomorrow.

What sets Titan’s efforts apart?

  What truly sets Titan apart is their ongoing commitment to 

aligning with their long-term Pragati objectives of carbon 

neutrality by 2030. Take Titan Vanam, for example: a scientific 

project that is bringing new life to 45 acres of degraded forest 

by planting over 208,000 native saplings from more than 120 

species in a high-density forest. We have even introduced 

solar-powered watering and smart surveillance systems to 

nurture this green space with the best of technology.

Tell us about reviving the Veerasandra Lake with Titan?

  Few years ago, Veerasandra Lake was little more than a 

dry, forgotten swamp, quiet and lifeless. Today, it has been 

lovingly restored into one of Bengaluru’s purest lakes, thriving 

entirely on rainwater. When the monsoon arrives, the lake 

fills up, mirroring the sky above, a peaceful, vibrant space 

that feels like a breath of fresh air for the entire community.

What is the community impact of this project?

  This has positively impacted the groundwater levels within 

the community. Since its rejuvenation, the lake has come 

alive with rich biodiversity. The central island, now dense 

with trees, attracts over 20 species of birds, rising even 

more during migratory seasons. Around 2,000 plants and 

shrubs thrive around the lake, nourished by its own water. 

During peak summer, when the lake runs low, we take care 

to preserve its ecosystem, relocating fish to smaller ponds 

within the lakebed to keep them alive.

How has this project impacted your team?

  This project has revitalised the lake’s ecosystem, bringing 

back water storage, trees, birds, and fish, while also providing 

steady livelihoods for 8-10 gardeners who care for the area 

daily. This project has become a meaningful urban example 

of ecological conservation that our team is proud to support.

than a swamp, Venkataramana Naidu - our 
dedicated maintenance-in-charge for the

Safety Analysis (JSAs) for high-risk tasks. Contractor safety is 

tracked, reviewed monthly, and top performers are rewarded. 

Those who proactively raise alerts or identify risks are recognised 

during safety events, reinforcing the right behaviours.

Any moment that truly reflects Titan’s safety culture?

   Something truly inspiring happened at Lucknow airport. 

One of our team members stepped in during a critical 

moment and performed CPR on a passenger in distress, 

showcasing our safety values extend beyond the workplace.

What role does leadership play?

   Senior leaders review safety plans quarterly, join walk-

throughs, raise alerts, and drive flagship programmes like 

Dare to Care and Suraksha. Most importantly, they act as 

role models when it comes to Safety related matters and 

ensure availability of resources constantly to maintain safety 

standards.

Describe Titan’s safety culture in three words.

   Proactive. Caring. Shared.

He is among the longstanding vendor 
partner from Yuno Packaging who 
has been instrumental in integrating 
recycled plastic solutions into our 
packaging ecosystem, contributing 
meaningfully to our sustainability goals.

How did your association with Titan begin?

  We’ve been working with Titan for over ten years now. From 

the beginning, our relationship has been guided by trust and 

shared values. Their transparent and ethical approach has 

made our journey together a meaningful one.

How has this partnership evolved, especially in the context 

of sustainability?

   Over the years, Titan has made a conscious effort to involve 

us in every change that affects the business and ecosystem. 

When new EPR guidelines were introduced, we weren’t familiar 

with the details. Titan’s sourcing and purchase teams helped 

us understand the alternatives, ultimately benefitting the 

ecosystem.

What changes did you implement as a result?

  We ran multiple trials with raw material suppliers to increase 

the recycled content in our plastic packaging. At the same 

time, we also explored paperboard alternatives to reduce 

plastic usage. Titan’s sourcing team was closely involved in 

testing for durability and customer experience, while the 

marketing team helped us refine the design. 

What impact have you seen from these efforts?

  We have managed to reduce plastic usage from 200 

tonnes to just 50 tonnes in the packaging we supply. It’s a 

significant shift, and one that has taught us a lot. We now 

feel better prepared to take on similar challenges going 

forward, knowing that we are not working alone but as part 

of a larger, committed ecosystem.

Dr. Dennis Chauhan

He is the Head of the Socio-economic 
Empowerment Programme at SVYM. He has 
dedicated nearly 30 years to uplifting tribal 
communities along the Kabini river – an effort 
supported through our CSR initiatives.

What makes the Titan–SVYM partnership unique?

  Titan and SVYM share grassroots origins and a commitment 

to inclusive development. The partnership is built on mutual 

trust, shared values, and a focus on uplifting underserved 

tribal communities, especially around Bandipur and 

Nagarahole.

What impact has this partnership had on tribal youth?

  While Titan has been a long-standing partner with us in 

educating tribal youth and providing employment-led skilling 

in many trades in the recent past. With Titan’s support, we 

introduced programmes like Ecotourism and Hospitality 

Management, which provide sustainable livelihoods aligned 

with local opportunities. These interventions have helped 

tribal youth transition from forest-dependent living to skilled 

employment.

Can you share an example of co-creation?

  The Ecotourism course was co-designed after discussions with 

Titan. It is now thriving. We also collaborated on agriculture 

training programmes tailored to local needs.

How has Titan helped bring community voices forward?

  Within the tribals, the most critical are the stories of the 

successful. Community leaders or beneficiaries feel proud to 

share their stories. These efforts build confidence and improve 

access to public schemes and recognition.

How has your experience as a person with disability shaped 

your approach to design?

   My hearing loss has given me a heightened visual sense. I 

observe the world more sharply, and that attention to detail 

naturally carries into my work. It helps me anticipate trends, 

create strong visuals, and connect with customers in ways that 

often go beyond words.

Can you share a moment when your design perspective led 

to something unique?

   Yes, during the development of Fastrack’s Fastfit collection. I 

proposed a rectangular watch case, which initially didn’t receive 

much support internally. Still, I trusted my understanding of 

what active, style-conscious customers would appreciate. The 

product turned out to be a commercial success. 

Can you recall a time when Titan’s culture made you feel 

genuinely heard and valued?

   During a critical product review, the team encouraged me 

to present my design idea independently - even though 

communication takes a little more coordination. It made me 

feel respected not as a differently abled person, but as a 

professional with something valuable to offer.

If you had to describe Titan’s inclusion culture in just three 

words, what would they be?

   Empathy, support, and openness.

Is ethical conduct important at the workplace?

  Absolutely. It builds a respectful environment where people 

feel valued. Ethics ensures that fairness is not left to chance 

- it becomes a shared standard that everyone upholds.

When did you first understand its importance?

   A former colleague once shared how a senior at 

their previous workplace humiliated a teammate in 

public. The team lost its spirit. That story stayed with 

me. It taught me that ethics is not just a guideline - 

it shapes how people feel and perform at work.

How does Titan foster ethical conduct in daily work?

  Ethics at Titan is practise, not just preached. Whether 

it’s how we handle sensitive data or how we engage 

with teammates, there’s a culture of mutual respect and 

accountability. We are reminded often that doing the right 

thing is everyone’s responsibility - not just a policy to follow.

the craftsmanship and community 
engagement embedded in our 4P 2.0 
programme, preserving traditional skills 
while embracing modern practices.

How was your weaving journey before Titan?

  There was a time when I led a thriving cooperative of 

handloom weavers in Samudragarh, West Bengal. But when 

mechanised looms took over the market, everything changed. 

Orders dried up, weavers left in search of other livelihoods 

and the looms fell silent. Debt piled up, and our once-bustling 

sheds stood still, silent witnesses to a vanishing tradition.

What changed when Titan stepped in?

  Just when we had almost given up hope, Taneira reached 

out. With their support, we slowly began to rebuild, repairing 

broken sheds, bringing in better equipment and most 

importantly, restoring faith in the craft. Today, that effort 

has blossomed into something truly special, we have become 

India’s first all-women Weavershala. 

What improvements have you experienced?

  The transformation has been remarkable. From pit looms to 

ergonomically designed frame looms, our work is far more 

productive. Electric jacquard machines and motorised lifts 

help us create complex designs efficiently. The switch from 

thigh reels to machine reels has reduced physical strain. All 

this has enhanced our comfort, productivity, and earnings.

What inspired you to take on the 6,000 km Titan 

ECHO journey?

   The journey was not about recognition or records, it 

was about purpose. I undertook the 6,000 km skate 

for Titan ECHO to raise awareness and support for 

underprivileged girls through the Titan Kanya initiative. 

There were times along the road when fatigue set 

in and doubts crept in. But what kept me moving 

forward was a simple, continuous belief: doing the 

right thing doesn’t require an audience.

What ethical lesson did this experience leave you with?

   That journey became a powerful teacher. It reminded me 

that truth needs no rehearsal. It’s a value I hold close, 

one that continues to guide me every day, not just as a 

professional, but as a person. It’s about staying grounded 

in purpose, even when no one is watching.

Growing Our Financial Performance

We closed the Financial Year 2024-25 
with a significant milestone. Our 
jewellery sales surpassed ` 50,000 
crore for the first time, reflecting a 
20% growth over the previous year. 
This was not merely a commercial 
achievement. It signalled the strength 
of our brands and the consistency 

of our value proposition. Despite 
a challenging start to the year due 
to a subdued wedding season and 
external factors like elections, the 
business picked up momentum 
following a reduction in customs 
duty in July 2024. The latter half of 
the year witnessed strong festive and 

wedding demand, which we met with 
agility and focus. We responded to 
gold price fluctuations with proactive 
bullion management. This included 
intelligent use of Gold on Lease and 
stringent controls on inventory without 
compromising on product variety or 
availability.

Growing Meaningful Customer Engagements

In a market driven by economic 
shifts, changing gold prices and 
evolving customer preferences, we 
remained steady in our vision. The 
division deepened its connection with 
customers, reimagined innovation 
across its value chain, and expanded 
its presence in India and beyond. The 
year’s journey was not only about 
numbers. It was about reaffirming 
trust, delivering elegance, and crafting 
experiences that go far beyond the 
jewellery itself.

In Financial Year 2024-25, over 3 
million customers purchased jewellery 
from us, many returning for repeat 
purchases or referring others. This 
trust hasn’t emerged overnight, it 
has been earned through years of 
consistent quality, transparent pricing, 
and thoughtfully crafted, personalised 
experiences.

During the year, we saw an increase 
in demand for daily-wear, lightweight 
gold pieces and bridal collections, even 
as diamond jewellery performance 
remained mixed. Our introduction of 
18 karat collections and investment-

focussed offerings helped us address 
both sentiment and affordability, 
particularly in price-sensitive segments.

Our Gold Exchange Programme 
continued to be a strong driver of 
footfall. During the year, more than 8 
lakh customers exchanged 18+ tonnes 
of gold. We also extended our savings-
led products through the launch of the 
Rivaah Golden Advantage plan, which 
was designed to meet the unique 
needs of brides and their families. 
Together with Golden Harvest, these 
plans offered customers a dependable 
way to plan their jewellery purchases 
in an environment of volatile gold 
prices. We entered into a new 
partnership with De Beers to promote 
natural diamonds, building consumer 
confidence through extensive Diamond 
Awareness Sessions conducted 
nationwide.

We continued to listen closely to what 
our customers told us, through Net 
Promoter Scores, brand health tracking 
and retail mystery audits, helping craft 
meaningful interventions.

These efforts have created a 

manufacturing ecosystem that is agile,

together designers and business 
colleagues for deep trend research 
in areas such as wedding and fast

Our design process is rooted in a 
strong narrative shaped by macro 
trends, setting the tone for every

Growing our Financial Performance

The Financial Year 2024-25 was a 
defining year for Titan’s Watches & 
Wearables Division. This is when we 
continued to deliver robust double-

digit growth across brands, categories, 
and channels. We recorded ~17.2% 
growth in total income, reaching  
` 4,576 crore compared to ` 3,904 

crore in Financial Year 2023-24, 
driven by a strong increase in the core 
analogue segment.

Growing through Premiumisation 

belief that premium is not just a price 
point, but an experience, one that 
we are committed to delivering with 
greater intent and creativity.

In the International Brands portfolio, 
we are sharpening our play in the 
` 50,000–` 2.5 lakh premium and 
bridge-to-luxury segments, enriching 
the Helios assortment, with brands 
like U-Biot, Charriol, and Herbelin, 
accelerating the rollout of Helios Luxe 
stores across key metro markets. 
Together, these efforts reflect our 

Premiumisation remained a powerful 
engine of growth this year, shaped 
by our commitment to design, 
aspirational products, and immersive 
brand experiences. Each of our brands 
is charting its own distinct path on 
this journey. Titan is elevating its 
horological expertise with launches 
like Automatics, Stellar Next Edition. 
Fastrack is dialling up its fashion-
forward identity with trend-driven 
collections such as Oceanic, Cosmic 
Tribe and Iceberg Automatics. Sonata 
continues to resonate deeply with 
Bharat, with offerings like Sonata Gold 
and wedding-specific pair watches 
that blend tradition with elegance.

258-452103-257Statutory Reports04-102Corporate OverviewFinancial StatementsGrowing with Product Innovation

Innovation took centre stage this year, 
as we seamlessly blended exceptional 
craftsmanship, rich storytelling, and 
contemporary design across our 
diverse brand portfolio. 

Titan continued to push the 
boundaries of horology with the 
unveiling of India’s first Tourbillon 
watch, launched as part of the 
40 Years of Joy Commemorative 
Collection. Limited to just four pieces, 
each priced at ` 26 lakh, the collection 
sold out within a month, firmly placing 
Indian watchmaking on the global 
map.

The Edge range had a particularly 
remarkable year, growing 35% 
and making waves with innovative 
launches like Edge Carbon Fibre. Edge 
also broke new ground internationally, 
becoming the first Indian brand to 
enter the prestigious Geneva Watch 
Grand Prix (GPHG) with two bespoke 
timepieces. The recognition continued 

with Edge Ultraslim winning the 
renowned German iF Design Award. 
Raga Memoir brought its signature 
storytelling to life with elegant 
timepieces inspired by memory, 
emotion and timeless grace.

Fastrack deepened its bold, 
youthful identity with an exciting 
slate of launches including Fleek: 
Quartz Multifunction, Gambit with 
Micromotors, and the After-Hours 
collection. In the smart wearables 
space, Titan strengthened its portfolio 
with the launch of the Titan Celestor 
and Crown collections, fusing 
technology with refined aesthetics.

Sonata underwent a successful 
transformation, embracing a refreshed 
design language that resonated with 
modern consumers while staying 
true to its roots. In the fast-fashion 
segment, Poze and Vyb made a 
strong impression, winning over 
Gen Z with bold, trendy designs and 
tapping into a fashion-first mindset.

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDGrowing through Manufacturing Excellence

Titan’s watches manufacturing has 
embraced cutting-edge technology 
and automation to boost precision, 
efficiency, and quality. Across watch 
assembly locations, AI and IIoT-driven 
initiatives have automated the watch 
running tests, enabling real-time 
measurement of stoppages, time 
variation against GPS standards.

spectrophotometric plasma sensors, 
delivering better coating consistency 
and material savings. Leveraging 
Swiss expertise, premium finishing 
techniques such as Côtes de Genève, 
Perlage, and Sunburst have been

Growing our Financial Performance

The Financial Year 2024-25 was a 
year of steady financial progress. 
The Eyecare Division recorded a 
revenue of ` 796 crore, marking a 
9.9% year-on-year growth. This was 
underpinned by a deliberate focus 
on expanding affordable offerings, 
growing international brand presence, 
and doubling e-commerce sales. These 
efforts also reflected in improved 
customer satisfaction, as our Net 
Promoter Score (NPS) moved from 76 
to 82. EBIT stood at ` 85 crore, with 
margins of 10.7%, before exceptional 
items.

Our strategy to refresh the store 
experience also contributed to 
performance. Close to 100 stores 

were renovated, and we introduced 
the new ‘Runway’ store format, 
tailored for premium sunglasses. These 
upgrades, along with key milestones 
like the patent for Titan Clear Sight 
and accolades at the Effie Awards 
and AdFest Asia, reflect our growing 
reputation in both innovation and 
brand building.

Product volumes across frames, 
sunglasses, and lenses grew in 
healthy double digits, with lenses and 
sunglasses leading the momentum. 
This balanced growth continues to 
reinforce our dual positioning as both 
a trusted eye care provider and a 
fashion-forward brand.

Growing through Omnichannel Integration

Consumer expectations are evolving 
quickly, and we’re adapting by 
building a seamless experience across 
both digital and physical channels. 
Over the past 18 to 24 months, our 
website - titaneyeplus.com - has 
seen a fourfold increase in both 
customer base and value. More than 
just an online store, it has become 
a comprehensive eye care platform 
offering personalised communication, 
virtual consultations, and curated 
product recommendations.

Titan Eye+ is one of the largest multi-
brand retailers of Eyewear with over 
800 stores nationwide. Our expansion 
efforts were focussed and disciplined. 
Rather than chasing numbers, we 
prioritised locations with long-term 
potential, targeting a net addition of 
over 50 new stores.

The rising preference for premium 
international brands reflects a shift 
in Indian consumer behaviour. To 
stay ahead, we are curating brand 
portfolios by catchment, following 
a multi-brand and multi-segment 
strategy. While international brands 
are contributing to value, our in-house 
brands continue to drive volumes, 
ensuring a balanced growth trajectory.

Our Eyewear business made 
meaningful progress in international 
retail, expanding to 7 stores during the 
year.

Growing with Product and Technological Innovation

Innovation continues to be at the heart 
of our value proposition. In Financial 
Year 2024-25, we rolled out several 
tech-enabled features to enhance the 
customer journey, both in-store and 
online. These included AI-powered 
lens recommendations, contactless 

frame height and pupillary distance 
measurements, VoiceX pilots, and AI-
based virtual try-on tools.

Our product launches stayed closely 
aligned with evolving consumer 
expectations. Highlights included the 
Titan x Marvel collection, upgraded 
clip-on frames, and the Fastrack x MI 
8 series. In lenses, innovations such 
as the Titan Digital Centralised App 
and the Titan x Zeiss Photo Fusion 
range elevated both functionality and 
user experience. We also introduced 
smart, stylish offerings like Fastrack 
Vibes sunglasses at ` 2,900. Thus, 
underscoring our focus on combining 
innovation with everyday wearability.

On the frame side, we launched 
collections inspired by yoga stretches, 
offering frames with temples that 
open up to 180 degrees - merging 
mindful design with elegant aesthetics. 
We also introduced advanced 
techniques like aluminium transfer for 
graphic detailing and dual colouring 
for striking multi-tone finishes.

At Titan EyeCare, we continue to 
strengthen our manufacturing 
capabilities to drive product 
innovation and visual wellness. In lens 
manufacturing, we introduced the 
Myoslow design to help slow myopia 
progression in children. Our Titan 
Initia progressive lenses offer reliable 
performance at an accessible price, 
meeting the needs of value-conscious 
customers. As part of our design 
enhancement initiatives, we have 
developed new tint shades in vibrant 
tones like Peachy Topaz, Plum, Gradal 
Citrine Amethyst, and Garden Green, 
expanding both style and function.

Safer Roads

To tackle the often-overlooked issue of poor 
vision among India’s driving community, 
we at Titan Eye+ launched a nationwide 
initiative to make eye care accessible and 
practical for truck drivers, cab drivers, 
rickshaw pullers, and delivery partners. 
Since June 2024, we have conducted free 
vision screenings for over 42,000 drivers in 
over 300 cities. A standout feature of the 
programme is our creative ‘Eye Test Menu,’ 
set up at dhabas, where drivers could 
casually test their vision while placing food 
orders, followed by immediate screening 
by our optometrists. Those identified 
with impaired vision received subsidised 
spectacles delivered directly to their homes.

Reporting Period and Scope 

The scope of this <IR> is limited to Titan Company Limited as 
a standalone entity for Financial Year 2024-25.  

Approach to Materiality 

Materiality supports development of an effective ESG strategy and long-term 
value creation. In Financial Year 2023-24, the Company updated its approach to 
materiality assessment and adopted a double materiality assessment approach, 
to identify, examine and score various potential material topics to arrive at a single 
prioritised list of material topics. The Company collaborated with its stakeholders 
to identify material issues, collecting insights from multiple stakeholder forums 
within the organisation as well as externally. This list of material issues has 
effectively helped shape the ESG strategy for the entire Company. 

The Double materiality study among others has been a key input towards our long 
term ESG strategy Pragati.

This Financial Year marks the 8th 
year of the Company's Integrated 
Reporting. Through this Report, the 
Company reaffirms its dedication to 
maintaining the highest standards of 
transparency in communication and 
adherence to corporate governance 
principles. On a voluntary basis, the 
Company discloses both qualitative 
and quantitative information to 
stakeholders, showcasing the non-
financial objectives it has achieved 
in previous years. A significant 
positive development during the 
year has been the inclusion of the 
Company’s sustainability strategy 
(Pragati) covering aspects across 
Environment (E) Social (S) and 
Governance (G). Besides this, the 
Integrated Report <IR> presents 
the Company’s performance 
across various material aspects, 
including Human, Natural, Social & 
Relationship, Intellectual, Financial 
and Manufactured Capitals, thereby 
reinforcing long term value creation. 
Additionally, crucial aspects such 
as stakeholder engagement, risks, 
governance, CSR, and environmental 
initiatives are detailed under the 
Double Materiality Assessment 
(DMA), the Annual CSR Report 
and other statutory reports like 
the Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report (BRSR) of this

The Company’s DMA has been 
conducted by a reputed third party 
in accordance with the guidance 
provided by the European Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ESRS), a key 
standard setting body.  

DMA consists of two parts, namely, 
Impact Materiality and Financial

materiality assessments are performed 
as part of the DMA, as they are 
interrelated and the interdependencies 
between these two dimensions need to 
be considered.

engagements. The Company has engaged with 
the following stakeholders:

  Senior Management & Heads of Department

  Investors 

  Values Chain Partners (Suppliers, Vendors, 

Distributors and Direct Dealers)

  Business Associates (Franchisees and Media 

& Advertising Agencies)

  Customers

  Government, Local and Industry Bodies

  Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)

The first step in the DMA is 
identifying and creating a 
prioritised universe of issues 
through reviewing global risks 
as well as peer research. 

Material Issues

The third and final step is 
collating and scoring all the data 
(attaching specific weightages 
to each topic) based on ESRS 
scientific methodology to arrive 
at a prioritised list of topics 
and plot them on the Double 
Materiality Matrix. 

Based on the assessments carried out, the Company has arrived at the following seven material topics categorised as critical which 
will largely be the focus for the coming years and is the basis of the Company’s ESG strategy. 

01

Carbon, Emissions & Energy 

Investing in cleaner technologies and 
adopting renewable energy can aid 
in reducing the Company’s carbon 
footprint while mitigating the impacts of 
climate change. The Company annually 
conducts energy and emissions audits 
and is continuously trying to identify 
opportunities for energy reduction and 
the integration of renewable energy 
sources. Financial Year 2024-25 saw 
significant investments in renewable 
energy across the factory locations 
of Hosur, Coimbatore, Pantnagar and 
Roorkee setting the foundation stronger 
for a greener roadmap.

Water Management 

Implementing water conservation 
measures and ensuring effective 
wastewater treatment before discharge 
can help minimise environmental 
impact while enhancing water 
security for local communities. The 
Company complies with all applicable 
water management regulations and 
continually seeks improved methods to 
measure and reduce water consumption 
through advanced technologies, 
lake rejuvenation and development 

projects and workforce behaviour 
change initiatives. Significant thrust 
in Financial Year 2024-25 for water 
augmentation was driven through 
waterbody restoration projects across 
7 different locations. In addition to 
creating additional capacities for water 
storage, these projects have enhanced 
flood resilience, ground water recharge 
and enhanced cultivable area across the 
locations.

03

Waste Management and Circular Economy 

Effective waste management and 
circular economy practices not only 
minimise environmental impact but 
also support resource conservation and 
job creation. Poor waste management 
can result in landfill accumulation and 
public health concerns. Inadequate 
waste handling or failure to adopt 
circular strategies, especially amid 
increasing regulatory scrutiny, may 
harm the Company’s reputation. Proper 
segregation, handling and disposal 

of various waste types through 
authorised entities is essential. The 
Company is actively pursuing circular 
economy initiatives and processes to 
reduce and repurpose various types 
of waste generated during production. 
Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) guidelines have been actively 
taken into account by the Divisions 
while formulating the new packaging 
strategies.

04

Corporate Governance 

Strong corporate governance helps 
cultivate a culture of ethics and social 
responsibility, which can enhance 
employee well-being and working 
conditions. Effective governance 
practices also reinforce transparency, 
accountability and risk management 
within the Company. Breaches of 
ethical conduct, non-compliance with 

environmental regulations and lack 
of transparency could all harm the 
Company’s reputation and stakeholder 
trust. Mitigating governance risks 
involves implementing internal controls, 
employing risk transfer mechanisms and 
ensuring active governance oversight 
through Board involvement.

Customer Centricity 

Customer centricity is essential in retail 
as it enhances loyalty, drives repeat 
sales and distinguishes businesses 
in a competitive market. In today’s 
landscape, where consumers have 
numerous choices, prioritising customer 
centricity helps differentiate a retail 
brand, ensuring long-term success and 
sustainability. The Company’s state-
of-the-art manufacturing facilities 
and pan-India presence provide a 
competitive edge in meeting customer 
demands efficiently. Leveraging both 
existing and emerging technologies, 
the Company continues to develop 

innovative products that address 
customers’ latent needs. R&D and 
New Product Development teams 
work collaboratively to introduce new 
technologies, materials and products, 
catering to diverse consumer segments 
across brands and price points while 
maintaining high standards of quality 
and reliability. Net Promoter Score, 
Google Reviews and other listening 
mechanisms are actively used by 
the Company to continuously seek 
customer feedback and weaving them 
into the products and services.

06

Sustainable Raw Material 

By incorporating sustainable and/or 
recycled raw materials, the Company 
can help conserve natural resources 
and minimise environmental impact. 
Unethical or unsustainable raw material 
procurement can adversely affect local 
communities, while excessive reliance 
on non-renewable resources may 
contribute to depletion and biodiversity 

loss. The Company is formalising goals 
and objectives to reduce its dependence 
on finite raw materials by promoting 
material recycling wherever possible 
and adopting responsible sourcing 
and sustainable procurement policies. 
Responsible sourcing of Gold has been 
consistently pursued.

07

Sustainability Practices of Suppliers 

A well-implemented supplier code 
of conduct reflects strong corporate 
governance, enhancing the Company’s 
credibility among investors and other 
stakeholders. Additionally, sustainable 
practices can directly improve working 
and living conditions for supplier 
communities while generating indirect 
environmental benefits through reduced 
resource consumption. The Company 

has established certain policies and 
processes to ensure responsible 
sourcing and sustainable procurement 
before onboarding any supplier. 
Financial Year 2024-25 also saw a 
deeper engagement with suppliers 
on the principles of sustainability by 
the vendor management teams of the 
Company.

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB)

Over the past couple of years, the 
Company has continued its steadfast 
commitment to fostering diversity, 
equity, and inclusion (DEI) within the 
organisation. Recognising the intrinsic 
value of a diverse workforce and an 
inclusive culture, the Company has

NATURAL

Capital

As a responsible manufacturer, the Company acknowledges the 
significance of natural resources in creating valued products. 
The Company remains committed to reducing the environmental 
impact across its operations, including manufacturing units, 
karigar centres and office spaces. Established mechanisms, 
along with internal controls, aid in mitigating risks associated 
with increasingly stringent regulations on air and water quality 
and waste (effluent) management.

Energy

The Company's total carbon footprint, 
covering Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 
is approximately 30,278 tonnes of 
CO2e. Investments in rooftop solar 
installations within manufacturing 
facilities, along with offset solar and 
wind power units outside the plants, 
combined with a shift towards energy 
efficient technologies have enabled 
the manufacturing units to decrease 
dependency on non-renewable 
energy.

A 1MW grid connected solar plant has 
been installed near Chengam, Tamil 
Nadu to provide solar power to the 
Jewellery Hosur plant. Commissioned 
in July 2024, the solar plant has 

the capacity to generate 16 lakh 
solar units/annum, corresponding 
to a carbon footprint reduction of 
approximately 1,152 tonnes per 
annum.

Additionally, in the Jewellery Hosur 
factory, the steam-based cooking 
processes in canteens has been 
replaced by induction cooking 
vessels that use electrical energy. This 
significantly reduced diesel usage by 
5,536 litres from Financial Year  
2023-24, resulting in a carbon 
footprint reduction of 14.1 tonnes 
per annum.

At the Watches Hosur plant, an 
additional 160 kW capacity roof 
top solar is expected to result in an 
annual power generation of  
2.1 lakh kWh and help avoid 170 
metric tonnes annual CO2  emissions. 
Apart from this an energy efficient 
chiller has also been installed in the 
plant.  

At the EyeCare Chikkballapur 
factory to reduce carbon emissions, 

the plant came up with an idea to 
eliminate the incineration process of 
lens cutting waste. The incineration 
process for treating waste from lens 
manufacturing releases about 0.253 
kg of carbon emissions per kg of waste 
combusted. The EyeCare team ideated 
and came up with a plan to convert 
lens cutting waste into construction 
materials like paver blocks and kerb 
stones which are utilised for the plant’s 
parking area.

Retail stores have been working 
on optimising energy consumption 
through multiple measures, including 
HVAC monitoring and optimisation, 
energy efficient lighting systems and 
utilising renewable energy where 
possible. The Company has also 
created policies to encourage EV 
purchases by employees and as a 
result, there has been a significant 
increase in the usage of EVs across 
office locations.

258-452103-257Statutory Reports04-102Corporate OverviewFinancial StatementsCarbon Offset and Afforestation

After months of careful planning in 
terms of location, species selection, 
methodology of plantation, the 
Company executed an afforestation 
project creating two green belts across 
Thorapalli and Billanakuppam areas 
of Krishnagiri district where 2.08 lakh 
trees were planted. Both the projects 
collectively are expected to remove 
800 tCO2e annually and will result in 
two urban forests. The plantations 
would be maintained for 3 years.

The idea was to create a green belt 
around Hosur which is a rapidly 
industrialising city. This project is 
aimed at preserving native and listed 
species of plants and removing invasive 
species. 120+ native tree species 
have been planted during this activity 
which saw collaboration across Local 
Administration, academia, reputed 
organisations involved in carbon 
projects and NGO partners.

In Financial Year 2024-25 all three 
EyeCare units, celebrated World 
Environment Day by organising tree 
plantation drives. At Jewellery Hosur, 
an estimated emission reduction of  
3.2 tonnes per annum has been 
achieved by planting 150 trees and 
750+ shrubs. A rooftop planting 
drive was also carried out, creating 
an oxygen park to attract birds and 
promote biodiversity conservation 
while simultaneously achieving a 2.1 
tonnes per annum carbon footprint 
reduction.

Tree plantation drives undertaken by 
the Jewellery Pantnagar factory in 
Financial Year 2024-25 have resulted 
in the planting of 10,890 trees, 
bringing the total number of trees 
planted in Pantnagar to 1,12,390. This 
corresponds to 2,416 tCO2e absorbed 
per year and an oxygen production 
sufficient for 4.5 lakh people per 
annum.

Financial Statements

The Company acknowledged India's critical water stress and launched initiatives both within and beyond its premises to 
prioritise water conservation and augmentation. In Financial Year 2024-25 several water body rejuvenation projects have been 
undertaken across Tamil Nadu and Karnataka:

  Gunduperumbedu lake (400 acres) is in a village in the Sriperumbudur block, Kanchipuram district of Tamil Nadu. The key 
deliverables for this rejuvenation project were flood mitigation, avoiding water runoff and enhancing the natural resource 
base of the village. The initiative is projected to augment the lake's water storage capacity by around 2.6 kilo lakh litres.

  Polambakkam South Lake (26 acres) is part of an interconnected network of lakes in the Chengalpet region. The lake 

rejuvenation project is expected to augment the lake's water storage capacity by 0.6 lakh kilolitres. 

71

258-452103-25704-102  Masaorambhu Stream originates from the southwestern hills of the Western Ghats and extends approximately 5.63 km, 

eventually merging with the Noyyal River. The entire area covers 85,000 sq. metres. The focus of the project is on 
preventing water and soil runoff by reconstructing seven check dams across the stream and widening the channel. In 
addition to enhancement of water storage, the project is expected to reduce human elephant conflict by providing 
sufficient water storage upstream for the elephants.

Apart from the above-mentioned projects, other projects completed this year include the rejuvenation of two minor irrigation 
tanks in Krishnagiri, one minor irrigation tank near Madhurantakam (Chengalpet district) Hosur SIPCOT lake and a Kalyani 
rejuvenation near Chikkaballapur in Karnataka. 

Across the 7 water projects, we have augmented the water capacity by approximately 370 million litres or 3.7 lakh cubic 
metres, as well as enhanced water availability for irrigation/livelihood and increased the water tables in the vicinity besides 
enabling flood control. 

All the above programmes on water body restoration and afforestation form the building blocks into the Company’s  long 
term ESG goals with respect to Water Positivity and Net Zero Carbon. 

  Within the Company’s boundary, factories have taken 
up the initiatives to reduce their water intensity and 
maximise water recycling. 

The Jewellery Factory at Pantnagar has been steadily 
reducing its water consumption from 128 litres per capita 
per day in Financial Year 2019-20 down by more than 50% 
to 48 litres per capita per day in Financial Year 2024-25. 
Nearly half of the water consumed at the plant is recycled 
water. The Watches Factory at Hosur has also undertaken 
initiatives across factory operations to reduce their water 
consumption and recycle maximum amount of water. STP-
treated water has been utilised for restroom applications, 
resulting in an annual water savings of 5,400 kilolitres.

72

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDWaste Management and Circularity

Striving towards Zero Waste to 
Landfills, awareness sessions on 
Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) 
along with innovations to minimise 
material waste have reduced waste 
production across the Company. 
Company-wide awareness sessions 
on EPR have helped raise the urgency 
regarding EPR and focus on the next 
steps.

Aligned with EPR guidelines, the 
Company has initiated efforts to 
reduce and recycle plastic packaging. 
It has also partnered with plastic waste 
processors to ensure the responsible 
collection and recycling of plastic 
waste. Titan has adopted a proactive 
approach to circularity and gone 
beyond the responsible management 
of plastic packaging.

At the Watches Hosur unit, 2.8 
metric tonnes of hazardous waste 
was disposed to a pre-processor for 
cement industries for co-processing 
application. In Financial Year 2024-
25, approximately 40% of all waste 
in the plant generated was sent for 
co-processing to cement industries 
instead of a landfill.

Sourcing

From a circularity standpoint, the Company recycles gold, silver, and brass used in the production of various products 
including watches and jewellery. The jewellery exchange programme also serves as a platform for customers to contribute to 
the recycling of gold.

Interlinkage of Natural Capital with 
Other Capitals

The Company has always been mindful of resource usage and the growing 
impact of climate change worldwide. In response, it has been actively engaged 
in optimising resources while also focusing on resource enhancement and 
reuse. With the introduction of EPR guidelines, under which the Company has 
registered for plastics in packaging, batteries and e-waste, the emphasis on 
circularity, waste reduction and material recycling has significantly increased.

Tanishq Modern Muses

The magic of daytime elegance 
transforming into night-time brilliance 
- inspired by the mystical fireflies, for 
the first time ever, Glow in the Dark 
fine jewellery.  

Crafted in 14kt gold and studded with 
natural gemstones with a patent-
pending technique of glow pigment 
application creates an ethereal 
transformation.

The collection Modern Muses, designed for IBD Tanishq, is inspired by the Eastern 
Buddhist philosophy of “This is because That is”.  

With this in mind, the collection was designed for a woman who balances duality 
in her day-to-day life. The duality has been captured by a unique gemstone setting 
that is open on one side using prongs & closed on the other side like a channel 
setting.  

The gemstone setting has been internationally protected in various countries such 
as UK, Singapore, Australia, Bahrain, Oman, USA and UAE.

Relationships - Supply 
Chain Management 
and Responsible 
Sourcing Partners

The Company’s Integrated Supply 
Chain Management seamlessly 
balances in-house manufacturing 
with outsourcing through its vendor 
partners. The Company proudly refers 
to these vendors as strategic allies in 
its growth journey.

Across all its businesses, the Company 
has established strong mechanisms for 
vendors and supply chain partners to 
engage not only in business operations 
but also beyond. Many of these 
vendors have been associated with 
the Company since the inception of 
various divisions, playing a crucial role 
in the Company’s growth and success.

Whether through extensive 
engagement on the Tata Code of 
Conduct, compliance and regulatory 
requirements, vendor-partner meets, 
collaborative business planning, 
rewards and recognition programmes, 
or training initiatives in safety and skill 
development—the Company fosters 
a true collaboration with its vendors. 
Initiatives such as Karigar Day Out 
and ongoing capacity-building efforts 
further reflect this commitment.

92

Some of the Company’s initiatives 
which have set industry benchmarks 
are outlined below.

Transforming Lives: 
The Karigar Story

The gems and jewellery sector in India 
is a long-established industry that 
plays a significant role in the nation's 
GDP. Known for its labour-intensive 
nature, the industry often subjects 
craftsmen to extended working 
hours under unsafe and substandard 
conditions, including exposure to toxic 
gases, poor lighting, and unhealthy 
ergonomics, all of which limit their 
productive working lifespan.

For over a decade, the Company, 
through its Jewellery Division, has 
been at the forefront of social 
transformation within this sector, 
positively impacting the lives of 
many craftsmen. The transformative 
initiatives undertaken by the 
Company’s Jewellery Division have also 
influenced other industry players. The 
overarching goal is to revolutionise 
jewellery manufacturing in India 
while ensuring inclusive growth for all 
stakeholders in the value chain. 

The Karigar Centre initiative presents a 
sustainable model designed to address 
a critical industry challenge - attracting 
and retaining skilled artisans. It stands 
out as a unique initiative across India’s 
jewellery sector. Beyond providing 
state-of-the-art infrastructure. The 
Company has collaborated closely 
with vendors and Karigars to enhance 
business value by implementing 
various management, production, and 
quality systems. A significant milestone 
in this transformation journey is the 
establishment of a manufacturing 
centre in Midnapore, in collaboration 
with a vendor. As Midnapore is 

recognised as a hub for the Karigar 
community, this development allows 
artisans to work closer to home, 
fostering a sense of belonging and 
improving their quality of life by 
reducing the need for relocation.

In alignment with the Company’s 
vision, the Company aims to enhance 
the lives of Karigars by ensuring they 
can work without being separated 
from their families. In addition to 
improving the well-being of artisans, 
the Karigar Centre model delivers 
substantial business benefits, including 
a two-fold increase in productivity, 
consistent business growth for 
vendor partners, improved quality, 
reduced lead times and inventory 
levels, enhanced customer delivery 
performance, and the development of 
new capabilities.

Responsible Sourcing 
Practices

The Jewellery Division has developed 
and implemented a vendor code of 
practice known as the ‘4P – People, 
Place, Process, Planet’ framework, aimed 
at fostering a comprehensive and holistic 
transformation of the traditionally 
unorganised jewellery manufacturing 
sector. This framework has been 
extended to vendor partners, with 
regular third-party audits conducted 
to assess progress. The evaluations are

engagement and artisan well-being 
through store training, customer visits, 
azo-free dyeing, and health initiatives 
such as eye screenings. Operating 
in GI-tagged clusters, Weavershala 
supports artisans in securing GI 
tagging for authenticity.

Plans include expanding to 10 
new clusters, increasing women’s 
participation, and introducing 
electronic jacquard systems. Through 
Weavershala, the Company remains 
dedicated to empowering artisans and 
preserving India’s rich textile heritage.

reviewed by a dedicated team to ensure 
continuous improvement.

Diamonds are sourced from reputable 
and authorised ‘Sight Holders’ who 
purchase them from global diamond 
manufacturers adhering to the 
Kimberley Process for ethical mining. 
Additionally, these Sight Holders, 
who serve as the Company's vendors 
in India, operate under the Titan 
Supplier Engagement Protocol (TSEP), a 
comprehensive framework specifically 
designed for diamond sourcing. The 
core objective of TSEP is to uphold 
responsible sourcing practices, ensure 
traceability, and maintain pipeline 
integrity.

Vendor engagement within the 
Watches & Wearables (W&W) Division 
dates back to the Company’s inception. 
The Division has undertaken several 
initiatives to promote sustainable 
sourcing, including material recycling, 
carbon footprint tracking, vendor safety 
management, and the implementation 
of an environmental management 
system. Additionally, a scorecard has 
been introduced to monitor various 
sustainability parameters. 

Weaving with Dignity 
(Weavershala)

Taneira’s Weavershala is more than a 
weaving hub - it is an innovation lab 
where tradition meets technology 
to advance handcrafted textiles. This 
initiative enables experimentation 
with sustainable fibres like 
hemp, pineapple, bamboo, and 
banana while preserving heritage 
techniques such as Rangkaat and 
Hazaar Butti. By collaborating with 
master weavers and designers, 
Weavershalas continuously enhance 
their design capabilities to offer 
exclusive products.

Beyond design, innovation at 
Weavershala improves productivity 
and efficiency. Real-time tracking, 
a dedicated app, embedded quality 
checks, and ergonomic looms have 
boosted output, reduced rejection 
rates, and increased artisans' 
earnings. Currently, Weavershala 
supports over 500 artisans across 
14 clusters, with women comprising 
18% - a figure set to rise.

Interlinkage of Manufactured Capital 
with Other Capitals

The Company started as a manufacturing company and has flourished in the 
areas of design, distribution, retail, after-sales service and marketing. The 
Company’s state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities as well as the collaborative 
approach with vendors has been crucial in creating sustainable value. The 
Company continuously invests in upgrading technology and processes to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its manufacturing capabilities. With 
an aim to multiply opportunities and provide higher degrees of employment, 
the Company has been building up on its vendor network and has inaugurated 
multiple Karigar centres and Weavershalas which are managed by key partners. 
Multiple initiatives have been implemented to run the manufacturing operations 
efficiently and productively.

Statutory ReportsCorporate OverviewFinancial Statements258-452103-25704-102a)  Standalone Numbers:

 During the year, the Company crossed the milestone of 
` 50,000 crore in revenues. All the businesses witnessed 
satisfactory  growths,  while  successfully  navigating 
external  challenges.  The  sharp  volatility  in  gold  prices 
for  good  part  of  the  fiscal  year  had  an  impact  on 
consumer sentiments especially on the demand side as 
the consumer spending could not keep up at the same 
pace  as  the  growth  in  the  price  of  the  yellow  metal. 
Similarly,  there  was  a  sizeable  impact  on  profitability 
due  to  reduction  in  the  custom  duty  during  the  year. 
All  the  businesses,  however,  are  steadfastly  continuing 
their network expansion and focusing on market share 
growth in their respective categories.

 During  the  year  under  review,  the  Company’s  total 
revenue  grew  by  16%  to  `  54,842  crore  compared  to  
` 47,114 crore in the previous year.

 Profit before tax and exceptional items declined by 3% 
to ` 4,481 crore and the net profit declined by 6% to  
` 3,335 crore.

 The  Watches  &  Wearables  Division  of  the  Company 
recorded a revenue of ` 4,576 crore, a growth of 17%. 
The  revenue  from  Jewellery  Division  grew  by  21% 
touching  `  46,571  crore  (excluding  sale  of  bullion  of  
` 2,656 crore). The revenue from EyeCare Division grew 
by 10% to ` 796 crore.

 New  Businesses,  viz.,  Indian  Dress  Wear  Division 
and  Fragrances  &  Women’s  Bag  Division  recorded  a 
consolidated  revenue  of  `  406  crore,  a  growth  of  7% 
over the previous year.

 The Management Discussion and Analysis report, which 
is attached, showcases into the performance of each of 
the  business  divisions  and  the  outlook  for  the  current 
year.

b)  Consolidated Numbers

 At the consolidated level, the revenue stood at ` 60,456 
crore as against ` 51,084 crore in the previous year. The 
details of the performance of the Company’s subsidiaries 
are covered below in point 15 of this Report.

2.  Dividend

 The  Board  of  Directors  recommended  a  dividend 
on  equity  shares  at  the  rate  of  1100%  (i.e.  `  11  per 
equity  share  of  `  1  each),  subject  to  approval  by  the 
shareholders,  at  the  ensuing  Annual  General  Meeting 
(AGM)  and  payment  is  subject  to  deduction  of  tax  at 
source  as  may  be  applicable.  The  dividend  on  equity 
shares if approved by the Members, would involve a cash 

120

outflow of ` 976.56 crore resulting in dividend payout  
of 29% of the standalone profits of the Company. The 
Dividend Distribution Policy, is annexed as Annexure-III 
to this Report.

3.  Transfer to General Reserve

 As  permitted  under  the  provisions  of  the  Companies 
Act,  2013,  (the  Act)  the  Board  does  not  propose  to 
transfer any amount to general reserve and has decided 
to  retain  the  entire  amount  of  profit  for  the  Financial 
Year 2024-25 in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

4.  Public Deposits

 The Jewellery Division of the Company was successfully 
operating  customer  acquisition  schemes  for  jewellery 
purchases  for  many  years.  When  the  Companies  Act, 
2013  became  substantially  effective  on  1st  April  2014, 
the  Company  had  around  seven  lakh  subscribers 
contributing to these schemes. However, these schemes 
were  exempt  under  the  Companies  Act,  1956  relating 
to acceptance of public deposits, as such schemes were 
not covered in the definition of deposits. Under the Act 
and  the  Rules  made  thereunder  (Deposit  Regulations) 
the  scope  of  the  term  “Deposit”  was  enlarged  and 
therefore a view was taken that the jewellery purchase 
schemes offered by the Company to its customers would 
be treated as public deposits. Thereupon, the Company 
discontinued fresh enrolment of subscribers and initiated 
steps  to  close  the  erstwhile  customer  schemes,  which 
were wound down in August 2014.

 Under the Deposit Regulations, as amended from time 
to  time,  a  company  is  permitted  to  accept  deposits 
subject  to  applicable  provisions,  to  the  extent  of  10% 
of the aggregate of the paid-up share capital, securities 
premium  account  and  free  reserves  from  its  Members 
and 25% of the aggregate of the paid-up share capital, 
securities premium account and free reserves from the 
public after prior approval by way of special resolutions 
passed by the Members in this regard. Requisite approval 
was obtained from the Members of the Company and 
a new programme for customers to purchase jewellery 
(under  the  Jewellery  Purchase  Plan)  was  launched 
in  November  2014  in  compliance  with  the  Deposit 
Regulations.

 The details relating to Deposits, covered under Chapter 
V of the Act are as under:

(a)  accepted during the year: ` 3,458 crore

(b) 

 remained unpaid or unclaimed as at the end of the 
year: ` 1,788 crore

with Laws

 During  the  year,  the  Company  has  reviewed  its 
Internal  Financial  Control  systems  and  has  continually 
contributed to the establishment of a more robust and 
effective internal financial control framework, prescribed 
under  the  ambit  of  Section  134(5)  of  the  Act.  The

 To  enhance  lens  quality  and  streamline  operations, 
the  de-coating  process  has  been  upgraded  through 
equipment  modifications  and  process  optimisation. 
The  lens  de-coating  process  has  been  optimised  by 
modifying  two  compartments—one  for  ultrasonic  de-
coating  and  another  for  rinsing—each  with  filtration 
systems.  This  eliminated  manual  cleaning,  reducing 
scratches  and  cavity  dots.  KOH  concentration  was 
lowered from 20-22% to 12-14%, cutting chemical use 
by 20-30%. While the overall cycle time remains around 
11  minutes,  eliminating  manual  steps  has  improved 
process consistency and enhanced lens quality.

 In  Financial  Year  2024-25,  5.2  lakh  units  of  energy 
was  generated  from  the  361KW  rooftop  solar  system 
installed  in  the  factory  premises,  fulfilling  19%  of  the 
Division’s total power requirements.

 Two-wheeler- Green parking made out of paver blocks 
recycled by lens cutting waste, was inaugurated during 
the year. 

 The  replacement  of  the  earlier  streetlights  (of  4.1  kW) 
with  50W  solar  lights,  has  resulted  in  reducing  2,800 
kg of CO2 emissions per year ensuring long-term energy 
and environmental benefits.

• 

 The  transition  to  Sustainable  Waste  Management 
at  the  Kolkata  Lens  Lab  has  resulted  in  completely 
eliminating  the  6.8  tonne  of  yearly  carbon  emissions 
and  significantly  reducing  waste  management  costs, 
supporting a greener, more sustainable approach.

CSR Planet led initiatives:

In  the  endeavour  to  pursue  a  balance  between  People 
and  Planet  and  the  emphasis  on  water,  the  Company  had 
kicked  off  a  series  of  interventions  towards  water  body 
rejuvenation and restoration. Work started from the second 
quarter of Financial Year 2024-25 in two water bodies, one 
in Gunduperumbedu (Tamil Nadu- 400 acres) and another in 
Polambakkam (Tamil Nadu - 26 acres).

In  the  third  quarter  of  Financial  Year  2024-25,  two  more 
water  bodies  were  finalized  near  Hosur  (Tamil  Nadu,  about 
10-15  acres  each)  –  Dasanapuram  and  Bodichipalli  and  a 
series of check dams restoration across Masaorambhu stream 
in  Coimbatore  (Tamil  Nadu)  –  these  have  been  completed 
by  March  2025  in  addition  to  a  Kalyani  restoration  near 
Chikkaballapur, Karnataka.

The  sluice  gate  repair  done 
in 
Gunduperumbedu  lake  came  to  bear  fruit  with  immediate 
effect.  An  alternate  waterbody  was  identified  which  was 
Irrigation 
recommended  for  restoration  by  the  Minor 

in  the  third  quarter 

Department  and  Chengalpet  Collectorate,  and  restoration 
activities were commenced in Manapakkam lake in February 
2025  and  this  restoration  including  sluice  gate  repair  was 
completed by March 2025.

Across all these 7 waterbodies, the water capacity has been 
augmented by ~370 million litres or 3.7 lakh cu.m, enhancing 
water  availability  for  irrigation/livelihood  and  increased  the 
water tables in the vicinity besides enabling flood control.

Simultaneously  sowing  the  seeds  for  the  future,  two  green 
belts have been created near Hosur, where planting of 2.08 
lakh  trees  has  been  enabled.  The  carbon  sequestration 
potential would be approximately 800 tCO2e/year from these 
two projects.

The Board CSR & Sustainability Committee of Titan Company 
Limited  hereby  declares  that  the 
implementation  and 
monitoring of the CSR Projects is in compliance with the CSR 
Objectives and Policy of the Company.

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDManagement Discussion and Analysis

Performance during the Financial Year 2024-25

While Financial Year 2024-25 was marked by multiple external events that had varying impacts on the businesses in general, 
Titan’s businesses clocked yet another year of strong 22% revenue growth resulting in the Company crossing the impressive 
milestone of ` 50,000+ crore of revenues for the full year.

•

•

•

•

 The  Analog  Watch  business  continued  its  strong  growth  trajectory  by  product  innovation  led 
premiumisation whilst moving in sync with the rising aspirations of the Indian consumer.

 Elevated  gold  prices  in  the  Jewellery  Division  resulted  in  sluggish  consumer  demand  at  lower  price 
points leading to single digit buyer growth, while demand at higher price bands sustained resulting 
in a high double digit growth in sales. However, Studded jewellery registered low double-digit value 
(YoY) growth.

 The EyeCare business has returned to the double-digit growth trajectory in the third and fourth quarter 
of Financial Year 2024-25 and is poised for even better growth in Financial Year 2025-26.

 Within  Emerging  businesses,  Fragrances  has  performed  well  for  Financial  Year  2025-26  signifying 
growing acceptance of SKINN brand.

•

 The International Business expansions are progressing well in North America and GCC regions.

The Company continues to remain focused on market share expansion in their respective business categories and catering to 
the changing needs of the consumers it serves.

Titan has always pursued sustainable profitable growth by making people, process, 
and the planet a central part of its business operating model and decision making. 
The Finance function plays an important and direct role in ensuring that we have 
the right amount of investment supporting our Sustainability programme and clear 
governance of measurement and reporting of ESG metrics.

The  Financial  Year  2024-25  saw  a  good  year-on-year 
revenue growth of 16% in Net Sales Value. Analog watches 
grew  by  20%  which  led  to  a  significant  market  share 
increase  in  the  multi-brand  channels.  The  premium  wave 
continued  unabated  with  excellent  consumer  interest  in 
premium  brands  and  sub-brands  like  Titan,  Nebula,  Edge 
and Xylys. Retail chains like Titan World and Helios showed 
healthy growth in both overall as well as like-to-like stores 
growth.  The  mass  fashion  brands  like  Fastrack  and  Sonata 
had a remarkable turnaround from last Financial Year on the 
back  of  innovative  products  and  go-to-market  strategies. 
The Division had a good increase in buyers through the sub-
brands launched last year, Vyb from Fastrack and Poze from 
Sonata.

Brand  Titan  led  the  way  through  outstanding  product 
collection launches like Titan Stellar, Automatics and Raga.

Innovation  was  at  an  all-time  high  in  the  Division.  The  First 
ever  tourbillon  watch  from  India,  launched  as  part  of  the  
40 years of Joy Commemorative Collection saw huge interest 
in the world and the Indian watch community and heralded 
a new era for brand Titan. The Tourbillon watch, exquisitely 
crafted  in-house,  was  launched  as  a  Limited  Edition  of  
4  pieces  priced  at  `  26  lakh  and  was  sold  out  within  one 
month.

Brand Titan launched a special edition watch for celebrating 
Wing  Commander  Rakesh  Sharma’s  maiden  and  historic 
journey  to  space  –  a  Unity  watch  that  captured  the  world 

146

that  he  witnessed  from  space.  Titan  also  became  the  first 
Indian  brand  to  compete  in  the  Grand  Prix  Horologerie  de 
Geneve (GPHG) with 2 extraordinary timepieces in the Edge 
collection.

This  Financial  Year  saw  the  rollout  of  4  Helios  Luxe  stores, 
which is the next step towards elevated retail environments 
selling even higher priced watches than the Helios stores.

The Wearables category saw a significant decline due to low 
interest  from  consumers  after  3  years  of  dramatic  growth. 
In this situation, the Division’s Wearables business remained 
almost flat, thus gaining market share. The Division is in the 
process  of  conceptualising  and  executing  a  new  strategy 
built  on  deep  consumer  insights  of  different  segments  of 
Wearables’ users.

The  Division  crossed  a  total  of  1,235  own  stores  with  a 
network of 720 Titan World, 272 Helios, 239 Fastrack and 4 
Helios Luxe stores. The Multi-Brand Retail channel which had 
faced huge headwinds last year saw an impressive turnaround 
this year as a result of the transformation activities of the last 
two  years  and  better  operations.  Marketplace  E-commerce 
channels continued to show very good growth and increase 
in market share for the Division’s brands.

The  manufacturing  team’s  innovation  quotient  reached  an 
all-time  high,  marked  by  exceptional  progress  in  R&D.  The 
production  team  displayed  solid  efficiency  in  the  supply  of 
millions of watches, at the required time and at the requisite 
quality.

The  outlook  for  the  business  remains  very  positive  with 
good  growth  rates  in  mainline  analog  and  premium  watch 
segments and a muted growth in the Wearables segment.

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDIn a decisive move, we replaced conventional plastic-based watch packaging with 
eco-friendly alternatives like engineered paperboard, smart hinges, and magnetic 
cladding, reducing plastic usage by 240 tonnes annually. We have also invested in 
rooftop solar systems across all manufacturing locations, generating an additional 
12.5 lakh units of solar energy. This has led to a diverse clean energy mix of 10% 
solar and 66% wind.

Ms. Suparna Mitra, CEO, Watches & Wearables

Tanishq’s adherence to ESG principles has distinguished it as a conscious jewellery 
business. Its emphasis on sustainable manufacturing, responsible sourcing, and 
supporting craftspeople sets a global benchmark. IBD aims to share this story 
worldwide and maintain our responsible practices globally.

Mr. Kuruvilla Markose, CEO, International Business Division

Jewellery Division

The  Financial  Year  2024-25  witnessed  continued  jumps  in  gold 
prices (25% YoY) every quarter, a customs duty drop of 9%, Lok 
Sabha and State elections, continuing softness in solitaire diamond 
prices  due  to  international  demand  weakness,  and  increased 
competitive intensity driven by the growing formalisation of the 
industry. These forces kept the market and consumer sentiment 
volatile, and at the same time attractive particularly for the gold 
jewellery and coin categories.

Despite  this  environment,  the  Division  clocked  in  another  year 
of  healthy  20%  growth  and  a  same  store  growth  of  14%  over 
the last fiscal. Studded sale growth was relatively muted at 12%, 
largely  on  account  of  a  decline  in  high  value  solitaires,  but  it 
continued to see decent buyer and value growths in non-solitaire 
studded segment.

The Retail store transformation program of larger and remodelled 
stores,  additions  to  retail  network  (503  Tanishq  stores),  new 
light  weight  and  modern  product  collections,  deeper  thrust  in 
select  regional  markets,  omni-channel  digital  engine,  sustained 
investments in high value collections and wedding segment have 
each  contributed  to  this  growth.  Rivaah,  the  wedding  focused 
sub-brand of Tanishq has grown in strength and is now prominent 
across 250+ stores with a relevant yet distinctive product offering 
for all major communities.

147

Statutory ReportsCorporate OverviewFinancial Statements258-452103-25704-102The Division has tied up with international diamond supplier De Beers to jointly educate customers co-promote 
Tanishq Diamonds and reduce confusion amongst customers between Natural and Lab grown/synthetic diamonds. 
This collaboration also aims to increase penetration of diamonds in India, which remains a highly underpenetrated 
market.

Mia by Tanishq, a sub brand of Tanishq crossed the ` 1,000 crore mark growing in topline by 37% on the back of strong 
network addition, innovative products and marketing campaigns ending the Financial Year with 240 stores across 93 towns. It 
continues to capture the imagination of modern customers with unique designs, inspiring brand associations and digital-first 
marketing campaigns. Mia by Tanishq is also sold across 300+ Tanishq stores and is enabling recruiting new and young buyers.

CaratLane grew in topline by 30% and ended the year with a network of 300+ stores across 120 + towns. The omni-channel 
strategy, digital first marketing combined with innovative product lines has enabled it to win amongst the new age customer 
segment, which is also witnessing substantial competitive intensity with the entry of several new players. It has developed 
a greater thrust on gold jewellery given the wide interest in gold and a renewed ambition for its silver focussed sub-brand 
Shaya.

Zoya, the luxury brand is now present across 10 cities in India and a prominent presence through Zoya galleries in 5 Tanishq 
stores in the US. It is one of India’s largest luxury jewellery brand and has built an enviable base of discerning, well-heeled HNI 
clients. The brand’s appeal is driven by innovative design stories, intricately crafted products with rare stone cuts, an intimate 
retail experience and curated personalised experiences for its clients.

The  portfolio  play  of  the  Division’s  brands  is  well  poised  for  exploiting  the  large  opportunity  on  hand  by  tapping  different 
customer segments with unique brand propositions.

Outlook:

Elevated gold rates could see shifts in demand segments. Gold 
prices  are  expected  to  remain  high,  given  the  geopolitical 
and  macroeconomic  uncertainties  globally.  The  Division 
will  continue  to  prioritise  topline  growth  driven  by  market 
share  gain  with  sustained  investments  in  retail  expansion, 
product assortment in stores, new collections, manufacturing 
excellence and visible marketing. While volatility in consumer 
demand has become a way of life, the demand outlook for 
the  jewellery  category  in  India  continues  to  be  robust  with 
the  favourable  demographics,  GDP  outlook  and  precious 
jewellery as a store of value with a deep cultural connect to 
festivals and weddings.

Responsible Jewellery Supply Chain:

The Division continued to drive “Responsible Sourcing” with 
95% of its vendors now in the “Standard” category on the 
4P  (People,  Place,  Process,  Planet)  framework,  driven  by  a 
rigorous  third-party  assessment  programme.  100%  ethical 
sourcing of fresh London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) 
gold,  recycled  customer  exchanged  gold  and  100%  ethical 
diamond sourcing driven through a formal framework of Titan 
Supplier Engagement Protocol are all industry benchmarks set 
by the Division, in the backdrop of opaque industry practices 
in India’s Jewellery manufacturing ecosystem.

148

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDAt Tanishq, our journey to leadership has been guided by sustainability and 
governance, anchored in our 4P responsible sourcing framework of People, Place, 
Process, and Planet. We are committed to becoming net zero carbon and water 
positive by 2027 whilst staying the course on ethical sourcing and responsible 
manufacturing. With around 750 stores worldwide, we’ve built a model of 
governance that inspires trust and is a benchmark for ethical practices amongst 
our customers and all stakeholders. Winning hearts, be it karigars, partners or 
customers, is our true measure of success.

Mr. Ajoy Chawla, CEO, Jewellery

EyeCare Division

The  Financial  Year  2024-25  closed  on  a  high  note  for  the 
Division, registering a robust NSV growth of 11% and healthy 
buyer growth. While H1 recorded single-digit growth, Q3 and 
Q4 rebounded with impressive double-digit growth of 17% 
and  18%  respectively,  signalling  a  clear  upward  trajectory. 
This  performance  was  backed  by  significant  investment  in 
marketing to drive growth and build desire.

The year witnessed a surge in traction across multiple growth 
levers.  The  affordable  fashion  segment  emerged  as  a  key 
driver,  attracting  a  significant  number  of  new  customers 
into  the  ecosystem.  The  launch  of  the  “Initia”  progressive 
lenses  unlocked  a  new  segment,  with  over  80%  of  buyers 
being  first-time  users,  demonstrating  its  broad  appeal  and 
untapped potential. Progressive Lenses’ post price correction 
has  consistently  seen  double-digit  growth  throughout  the 
year.

To tap into premiumisation amongst consumers, the Division expanded its portfolio of international brands from 10 to 25 and 
experienced  robust  volume  growth  of  89%  in  the  segment.  The  Division  has  improved  customer  satisfaction,  with  the  Net 
Promoter Score (NPS) rising from 76 to 82, reaffirming its focus on customer delight. The Division renovated 100+ stores with 
an enhanced look & feel and introduced two new retail formats for Titan Eye+, along with the launch of its new retail format 
for premium sunglasses, “Runway”.

Titaneyeplus.com,  the  brand  website  continued  to  perform  well,  doubling  in  sales  and  buyers  on  the  back  of  better  user 
experience,  effective  marketing  and  the  introduction  of  “Tees  by  Fastrack”.  In  the  E-commerce  channel,  the  number  of 
buyers have also doubled, reinforcing the strength of the platform. The strong consumer growth across Titan Eye+ stores and 
E-commerce reaffirms a clear preference for omni-channel shopping and highlights the Division’s readiness to capitalise on it.

149

Statutory ReportsCorporate OverviewFinancial Statements258-452103-25704-102The Division pursued the goal of ‘Making Indian Roads Safe’ and released the award-winning ‘Eye Test Menu’ on World Sight 
Day, along with an on-ground drive to screen and provide spectacles to drivers. Over 40,000 drivers have been screened so far.

The year also brought in prestigious recognition and accolades—where the Division’s innovation on coatings, Titan Clearsight, 
was granted a patent, while its marketing excellence was celebrated with wins at the Effie Awards and Adfest Asia.

Project Pragati has made strong progress in shaping the Eyecare division’s 
sustainability vision for Financial Year 2024-25. The division met 19% of its power 
needs by generating 5.2 lakh units through rooftop solar panels and by replacing 
factory streetlights with solar alternatives. A 15,000 sq. ft. green parking area was 
also developed using 24.5 tonnes of recycled lens-cutting waste, promoting circular 
economy initiatives.

The Titan Eyecare division is integrating sustainability by introducing eco-friendly 
frames made from biodegradable materials like castor oil seeds. With over 50,000 
units sold, this is just the beginning.

The division is also reducing plastic usage in packaging by adopting alternative 
materials without compromising product safety.

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDFRAGRANCES & WOMEN’S BAGS DIVISION

The Division focuses on two distinct categories: Fragrances and Women’s Bags.

FRAGRANCES

The Fragrances business has succeeded in creating a wide range of “Exceptional Quality at Affordable Prices” Eau de Parfum 
fragrances starting with Fastrack perfumes at ` 895 to SKINN Nox Oud at ` 4,995 per 100 ml and many options in between. 
SKINN  brand  has  been  quite  successful  in  terms  of  democratising  usage  of  fragrances  in  India  and  making  fragrances  an 
essential part of everyday dressing and grooming rituals. SKINN brand has led the category over years, by being a leading player 
across department chains and online channels.

The  organised  perfumes  category  (Glass  bottle)  is  growing 
at an estimated growth rate of 18-20% with value segment 
(< 1,000 ` per 100 ml) growing the fastest at estimated rate 
upwards  of  30%.  The  premium  and  prestige  segments  are 
growing  at  12-13%  and  masstige  category  is  in  low  single 
digits. Online marketplaces are driving category adoption by 
the  consumers  by  upgrading  from  deodorants  to  perfumes 
and offering access, choice and attractive trial options. Quick 
commerce  is  growing  at  a  hyper  rate  taking  share  from 
traditional online marketplaces and general trade. However, 
larger  part  of  quick  commerce  growth  can  be  attributed 
to  higher  trials  with  convenience  into  low  penetrated 
geographies.

During  the  year,  SKINN  launched  Nox  Oud  and  24seven 
collection  which  have  been  well  received  in  the  market 
indicating  positive  consumer  response.  A  new  range  of 
Fastrack perfumes were also launched during the year which 
have been well received in the market.

The  Fragrances  business  registered  a  double-digit  growth 
rate  in  Financial  Year  2024-25  with  E-commerce  and  quick 
commerce  being  the  fastest  growing  channels  for  the 
business.

WOMEN’S BAGS

Organised women bags segment is estimated to be around ` 2,200-2,500 crore and unorganised size is at least 2 times of 
the organised market share, making it an exciting opportunity of ` 6,000 crore plus. The organised growth rates are in the 
range of 12-16%. The customers are being offered a lot of exciting options with varied price range basis their budgets and  

on  their  preferred  channel  of  choice.  The  segment  is

chains focusing on international brands and their own labels, 
well known domestic players, international fashion & luxury 
brands through exclusive outlets and fashion retailer brands 
with their labels.

a means to express themselves. The bag plays a defining role 
for social validation and symbol of status. Women own bags 
for multiple occasions defined by workwear, everyday casual, 
evening  outings,  parties/cocktail  and  special  occasions  like

through  design-led  innovation,  operational  excellence,  and 
a  more  organised,  thoughtful  approach  to  a  heritage-rich 
category.  Taneira’s  brand  awareness  and  salience  has  been 
strengthened  with  the  growing  retail  footprint,  impactful 
brand marketing, and an overall increase in brand visibility on

curated shopping experience, the brand distinctly stands out

Campaigns

initiatives,  starting  with  the  release  of  the  brand’s  first-
ever  film  that  brought  the  “Taneira  promises”  to  life.  With 
a  focus  on  becoming  the  go-to  wedding  destination  across

the freshness and vibrance of the season, Cottons of India, a

consumers  -  through  its  pioneering  ‘Weavershala’  initiative, 
now  active  in  18  Weavershalas  across  the  country.  This 
initiative  is  revitalising  India’s  rich  weaving  traditions  while 
empowering  the  next  generation  of  artisans,  with  strong 
focus  on  women.  A  key  milestone  is  the  launch  of  the  first

consumers  was  further  strengthened  through  engaging  in-
store experiences, Try @ Home services, and curated pop-up 
events across key markets.

Operational Excellence and Supply Chain Innovation

chain  network,  joining  hands  with  over  300  vendors  and 
engaging  more  than  12,000  artisans  across  the  country.

by  an  advanced  warehouse  management  system,  has 
enhanced  fulfilment  capabilities  and  streamlined  logistics. 
The  introduction  of  standardised  colour  cards  ensures 
consistency  in  dyeing  practices  across  vendor  partners 
nationwide,  leading  to  improved  quality  control.  In  an 
industry-first move, the brand has also implemented a tech-

be  a  powerful  platform  for  employee  voice  and  has  been

Excellence Model (TBEM). In 2021, the format was changed 
to  in-person  conversations  with  the  MD  and  Chief  People 
Officer, fostering a more in-depth listening culture. In 2024, 
the Managing Director and Chief People Officer spent over 
70  hours  engaging  with  more  than  400  employees  across 
13  locations,  listening  to  their  perspectives  and  feedback. 
An  in-house  portal  was  introduced  to  capture  inputs  and 
provide  timely  responses,  enabling  closure  on  91%  of  the 
suggestions received. This enhanced listening approach has 
inspired  several  new  listening  posts  across  the  ISCM  and 
retail  ecosystem.  The  Company  participated  in  the  Great 
Place to Work assessment to gather feedback across cohorts, 
spanning  generations,  genders,  and  levels,  enriching  our 
understanding  of  the  employee  experience.  Titan’s  efforts 
were recognised with a Silver Badge in the Culture category 
by  Brandon  Hall  in  2024,  reaffirming  our  commitment  to 
building a truly inclusive and responsive workplace.

Employee Relations

The  Company  continues  to  build  on  its  relations  with 
unionised employees with the mantra of trust, transparency, 
and  togetherness.  A  collaborative  forum  was  set  up  with 
companies  like  Ashok  Leyland,  TVS,  Bosch,  and  ITC  to 
exchange  best  practices,  address  ER  challenges,  and  align 
on  evolving  policies.  Each  quarterly  meet  features  a  review 
of  the  host  company’s  practices,  enabling  cross-industry 
learning. A quarterly ER bulletin further broadens perspective 
by highlighting key developments across the industry.

 BOARD EVALUATION CRITERIA

 The  Company  has  a  structured  assessment  process 
wherein,  the  Board  Nomination  and  Remuneration 
Committee  (BNRC)  along  with  the  Board  carried  out 
an  Annual  Evaluation  of  its  own  performance  and  the 
performance  of  the  individual  Directors,  as  well  as 
evaluation of the Committees of the Board. An indicative 
list  of  factors  on  which  evaluation  of  the  individual 
Directors,  the  Board  and  the  Committees  was  carried 
out included, Board structure and composition, degree 
of  fulfilment  of  key  responsibilities,  establishment 
and  delineation  of  responsibilities  to  Committees, 
effectiveness  of  Board  processes,  information  flow, 
functioning  of  the  Board/Committees,  Board  culture 
and  dynamics,  quality  of  the  relationship  between  the 
Board  and  Management,  contribution  to  decisions 
of  the  Board,  and  guidance/support  to  Management 
outside Board/Committee meetings.

 The Board deliberated on the recommendations derived 
from  the  evaluation  and  duly  recorded  individual 
feedback  from  the  Directors.  The  discussions  were 
substantive,  well-intentioned,  and  resulted  in  a  clear 
strategic direction and decisive outcomes. Based on the 

evaluation findings, assessments, and feedback provided 
by the Directors, the Board and Management have jointly 
established  a  set  of  action  points  for  implementation 
within the prescribed timelines. It was observed that the 
Board  Committees  operate  with  professionalism  and 
efficiency,  addressing  significant  matters  beyond  their 
legally  mandated  terms  of  reference.  The  evaluation 
further  underscored  the  cohesiveness  of  the  Board, 
the  establishment  of  a  Boardroom  culture  founded  on 
trust  and  cooperation,  and  discussions  characterised 
by openness, transparency, and the encouragement of 
diverse perspectives.

 Some  of  the  enhanced  focus  for  the  Board  going 
forward would be in the areas of ESG related aspects, 
Mergers  &  Acquisitions,  Trademarks  &  Patents  and 
Artificial Intelligence. This could involve regular meetings 
between committee chairs and the Board chair to ensure 
greater alignment and avoid overlaps or gaps. Progress 
on  recommendations  from  last  year  and  the  current 
year’s recommendations were deliberated at the Board 
meeting.  The  Independent  Directors  discussed  matters 
pertaining  to  the  Company’s  affairs  and  presented 
their  collective  views  to  the  Board  of  Directors.  The 
outcome of the Board Evaluation was positive, reflecting 
the  Board’s  effectiveness  in  discharging  its  duties  and 
responsibilities.  The  evaluation  also  identified  specific 
areas  of  improvement,  and  the  Board  is  committed  to 
engage  further  to  take  appropriate  actions  on  these 
fronts.

 SEPARATE MEETING OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

 For the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters related to the functioning of the Company as well as the 
Board, it is important for the Independent Directors to have meetings without the presence of the executive management. 
A separate meeting of Independent Directors of the Company (Annual ID Meeting) without the presence of the Executive 
Directors and the Management representatives was held on 28th March 2025, as required under Schedule IV to the Act 
(Code  for  Independent  Directors)  and  Regulation  25  (3)  of  the  SEBI  LODR.  The  Independent  Directors  expressed  their 
satisfaction with the desired level of the governance of the Board and the consistent improvement in scores pertaining to 
various aspects of the Board meetings as captured in the Board Effectiveness Review exercise. At the said meeting, the 
Independent Directors:

 Reviewed the performance of Non-Independent Directors and the Board of Directors as a whole;

 Reviewed the performance of the Chairman of the Company, taking into account the views of 
Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors;

 Assessed the quality, quantity and timeliness of flow of information between the Management

 Disclosure  of  commodity  price  risks  and 
commodity hedging activities: The Company is 
exposed  to  price  fluctuations  on  account  of  gold 
prices and this is managed by way of:

a) 

b) 

 Purchase of gold on lease from banks where 
the  commodity  price  is  fixed  only  when  the 
corresponding  sale  happens  to  customers. 
Thus,  the  Company  is  not  exposed  to  gold 
prices for this portion of purchase.

 Purchase of gold from customers (on exchange, 
outright jewellery) or spot gold where the risk 
is  managed  by  way  of  taking  a  sell  future 
position  in  the  Commodity  Exchanges  or 
Forward Contracts/OTC Contracts with banks 
(Including Banks at IFSC/GIFT) (subject to RBI 
& IFSCA regulation). On a later date when this 

is sold in the stores, the positions are squared 
off  through  Buy  Future/Buy  Forward.  Thus, 
there  is  no  exposure  to  gold  prices  for  this 
portion  of  gold  purchase  also.  The  Mark-to-
Market  of  outstanding  Sell  Future  Contracts 
is  done  on  a  daily  basis,  based  on  the  gold 
rate  fluctuation.  With  regard  to  Forward 
Contracts/OTC Contracts, no Mark to-Market 
will be applicable as per the Company’s terms 
of  Hedging  with  Banks  (Including  banks  at 
IFSC/GIFT).

 All  the  commodity  hedging  is  done  in  adherence 
to the “Bullion Risk Management Policy” approved 
by the Board and the Company has hedging limits

Committee  consisting  of  Senior  Management

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDRemuneration Policy

The philosophy for remuneration of directors, Key Managerial 
Personnel (KMP) and all other employees of Titan Company 
Limited (company) is based on the commitment of fostering 
a culture of leadership with trust. The remuneration policy is 
aligned to this philosophy.

This remuneration policy has been prepared pursuant to the 
provisions  of  Section  178(3)  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013 
(Act) and Clause 49(IV)(B)(1) of the Equity Listing Agreement 
(Listing Agreement). In case of any inconsistency between the 
provisions of law and this remuneration policy, the provisions 
of the law shall prevail and the Company shall abide by the 
applicable law. While formulating this policy, the Nomination 
and  Remuneration  Committee  (NRC)  has  considered  the 
factors laid down under Section 178(4) of the Act, which are 
as under:

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

 the level and composition of remuneration is reasonable 
and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of 
the quality required to run the Company successfully;

 relationship of remuneration to performance is clear and 
meets appropriate performance benchmarks; and

 remuneration  to  directors,  key  managerial  personnel 
and  senior  management  involves  a  balance  between 
fixed  and  incentive  pay  reflecting  short  and  long-term 
performance  objectives  appropriate  to  the  working  of 
the Company and its goals

Key  principles  governing  this  remuneration  policy  are  as 
follows:

• 

 Remuneration for independent directors and non-
independent non-executive directors

o 

o 

o 

 Independent  directors  (ID)  and  non-independent 
non-executive directors (NED) may be paid sitting 
fees (for attending the meetings of the Board and 
of committees of which they may be members) and 
commission within regulatory limits.

 Within  the  parameters  prescribed  by  law,  the 
payment  of  sitting  fees  and  commission  will  be 
recommended  by  the  NRC  and  approved  by  the 
Board.

 Overall remuneration (sitting fees and commission) 
should be reasonable and sufficient to attract, retain 

Annexure A

o 

o 

o 

o 

o 

o 

and motivate directors aligned to the requirements 
of  the  Company  (taking  into  consideration  the 
challenges  faced  by  the  Company  and  its  future 
growth imperatives).

 Overall  remuneration  should  be  reflective  of  size 
of the Company, complexity of the sector/industry/
company’s operations and the Company’s capacity 
to pay the remuneration.

 Overall remuneration practices should be consistent 
with recognised best practices.

 Quantum of sitting fees may be subject to review

Financial 
implications of the 
risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive 
or negative 
implications)

Climate change impact 
is growing day by day. 
Especially given the increasing 
regulations in this area a lack 
of prioritisation can negatively 
impact various ESG factors.

1)  Conducting carbon, emissions 

Negative – Risk

and energy audits and 
identifying areas of energy 
reduction

2)  Increased sourcing of 
renewable energy.

Negative – Risk

Negative – Risk

Positive – 
Opportunity

Poor waste management 
practices can lead to landfill 
buildup and public health 
issues. Failure to appropriately 
manage waste or to 
implement circular strategies, 
during a period of increasing 
regulation of the same, 
can negatively impact the 
Company’s reputation.

Ensuring different types of waste 
are segregated, handled and 
disposed of appropriately and 
by only authorised contractors 
of the State Pollution Control 
Board. Additionally, to develop 
and follow circular economy 
initiatives to reduce and reuse 
the waste created during 
production.

Water is becoming 
increasingly a scarce resource 
especially in India where the 
seasonal rainfalls are the 
primary source of water. Poor 
water management will lead 
to stress for the operations 
and employee well-being.

Strong corporate governance 
can foster a culture of ethics 
and social responsibility, 
potentially improving 
employee well-being and 
working conditions.

These practices would further 
promote transparency, 
accountability and risk 
management within the 
Company and hence amplify 
the Brand reputation.

Adhering to the existing water 
management regulations and 
establishing goals for reducing 
water. Furthermore, continuously 
discovering and implementing 
better ways to measure and 
reduce water usage through 
various technologies and 
behaviour change within the 
workforce.

Mitigating risk in corporate 
governance involves establishing 
internal controls, utilising 
risk transfer mechanisms like 
engaging in active governance 
oversight through Board 
involvement. Additionally, 
ensuring the timely and accurate 
completion and submission 
of all relevant compliance 
frameworks is essential to avoid 
regulatory penalties and potential 
reputational. damageTop of Form

In case of risk, approach to

Focusing on customer 
centricity drives higher 
satisfaction and cultivates 
meaningful relationships with 
the Company’s patrons. This 
approach also underscores 
sound governance, potentially 
increasing investor trust by 
showcasing the Company’s 
ability to consistently meet 
customer needs.

Ethical sourcing of raw 
materials can support local 
economies and enhance the 
Company’s image among 
consumers.

By using sustainable and/
or recycled raw materials, 
the Company can conserve 
natural resources and reduce 
environmental impact.

1)   Several initiatives to engage 
with customers through 
various means including 
virtual interactions

2)   Loyalty driven programs and 
promotion of products and 
services

3)   Enhanced customer 

experience at retail stores

4)   Leveraging of social media 

platforms to listen to 
consumers and engage 
continuously.

1)   Setting goals to reduce the 
Company’s dependence on 
finite and non-renewable 
raw materials by promoting 
recycling of materials 
wherever possible

2)   Adopting policies for 

responsible raw material 
sourcing and sustainable 
procurement, thereby 
ensuring product traceability.

sustainability performance in 
the supply chain

2)   Suppliers are required to 
sign commitments and 
assessments are conducted 
before onboarding the 
suppliers.

code of conduct is a sign of 
strong corporate governance, 
improving the Company’s 
credibility among investors 
and other stakeholders. 
Furthermore, sustainable 
practices can directly 
contribute to improved 
working and living conditions 
for the supplier communities 
and could result in indirect 
positive environmental 
impacts though reduced 
resource usage.

 Yes, EPR regulations for plastics used in packaging, e-waste and batteries is applicable for the Company.

 The Company has secured EPR registration and adheres to the applicable guidelines. As per the Plastic Waste Management 
(PWM) Rules, Rule No. 9, published in the Gazette of India on 14th March 2014 (CG-DL-E-15032024-253031), submission of 
waste collection plans to Pollution Control Boards (PCBs) is not mandatory if EPR obligations are met by the brand owner.

 Currently, we are in the process of aligning our waste collection plan with EPR guidelines across our stores and operations. 
To ensure compliance:

• 

• 

 The  Company  engages  with  Plastic  Waste  Processors  (PWPs)  and  aggregators  to  collect  an  equivalent  amount  of 
plastic packaging waste from the market on behalf of the Company and get credits points for the same.

 A similar process is followed for e-waste and battery EPR, where the Company purchases credits and take responsibility 
for waste collection and processing.

 These  initiatives  reinforce  the  Company’s  commitment  to  responsible  waste  management  and  compliance  with  EPR 
Regulations.

iv 

v 

 The  Company  follows  a  risk-based  approach  to  workplace  safety,  where  risks  are  identified,  quantified,  and 
prioritised for effective mitigation. Various initiatives and safety systems have been implemented to ensure a 
secure and well-equipped working environment. To minimise workplace hazards, comprehensive risk assessments 
are carried out by subject matter experts, focusing on machine-related hazards, electrical risks, work at height 
safety, and fire prevention measures. Contractor safety is reinforced through a structured Work Permit System, 
capability-building programs, contractor scoring, and equipment check mechanisms to ensure compliance with 
OSH standards.

 Emergency preparedness and response have been strengthened in alignment with anticipated risks. Stakeholders 
undergo training on response procedures, and emergency drills are conducted both at a localised level and on 
a mass scale to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing system and make necessary improvements.

 Ensuring the integrity of critical machines remains a priority. third party subject matter experts certify machines 
and related equipment to meet legal requirements, maintaining operational safety and reliability.

 Any  intervention  that  introduces  potential  risk  follows  a  structured  Management  of  Change  process,  where 
changes are initiated, reviewed, and approved to incorporate necessary safety control measures at the design 
stage.

 Ergonomic assessments are prioritised to identify and mitigate ergonomic hazards, to create a comfortable and 
safe working environment.

Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Members of Titan Company Limited

Basis for Opinion

Report  on  the  Audit  of  the  Standalone  Financial 
Statements

Opinion

We  have  audited  the  standalone  financial  statements  of 
Titan  Company  Limited  (the  “Company”),  its  ESOP  trust 
(the  “Trust”)  which  comprise  the  standalone  balance  sheet 
as  at  31  March  2025,  and  the  standalone  statement  of 
profit  and  loss  (including  other  comprehensive  income), 
standalone  statement  of  changes  in  equity  and  standalone 
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes 
to  the  standalone  financial  statements,  including  material 
accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to  the  explanations  given  to  us,  the  aforesaid  standalone 
financial  statements  give  the  information  required  by  the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and 
give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of 
the Company as at 31 March 2025, and its profit and other 
comprehensive loss, changes in equity and its cash flows for 
the year ended on that date.

Revenue recognition

See Note 2(ix) and Note 19 to standalone financial statements

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Standards 
on Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. 
Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in 
the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone 
Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent 
of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued 
by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  together 
with  the  ethical  requirements that are relevant to our  audit 
of  the  standalone  financial  statements  under  the  provisions 
of  the  Act  and  the  Rules  thereunder,  and  we  have  fulfilled 
our  other  ethical  responsibilities  in  accordance  with  these 
requirements  and  the  Code  of  Ethics.  We  believe  that  the 
audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial 
statements.

Key Audit Matter(s)

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the 
standalone financial statements of the current period. These 
matters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the 
standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our  opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a  separate 
opinion on these matters.

The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

The Company and its external stakeholders focus on revenue 
as  a  key  performance  indicator  and  considering  there  are 
performance targets, this increases the risk of misstatement 
of revenue recognized.

The Company recognizes revenue when the control of goods 
being sold is transferred to the customer. A substantial part 
of Company’s revenue relates to jewellery and watches which 
involves large number of transactions with retail customers 
and  sales  contracts  having  varied  contractual  terms  with 
distributors and franchisees.

In  view  of  the  significance  of  the  matter,  we  applied  the 
following  audit  procedures  in  this  area,  among  others,  to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:

• 

• 

 We  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  accounting 
policy for revenue recognition as per relevant accounting 
standard.

 We  evaluated  the  design  and  implementation  of  key 
financial controls and their operating effectiveness with 
respect  to  revenue  recognition  transactions  selected 
on  a  sample  basis.  These  included  general  IT  controls 
and key application controls over the IT system which 
govern revenue recognition, including access controls, 
controls over program changes and interfaces between 
different system.

258

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDThe key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

Hence, there is risk of misstatement of timing and existence 
of revenue being recognized inappropriately for sales made 
through  retail  outlets  on  cash  and  carry  basis  and  risk  of 
misstatement  of  existence  of  revenue  in  case  of  non-retail 
sales.

In  view  of  the  above,  we  have  identified  existence  (retail 
and non-retail sales) and completeness (retail sales only) of 
revenue as a key audit matter.

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

 We  reviewed  key  contracts  with  distributors  and 
franchisees  selected  using  statistical  sampling  to 
understand terms and conditions particularly relating to 
acceptance of goods.

 For retail sales, we performed substantive testing using 
statistical  sampling  on  sales  made  on  a  particular  day 
and  tested  the  underlying  documents,  which  include 
tracing  day  sales  of  the  retail  outlet  to  the  collection 
reports and bank statements.

 Additionally,  we  tested  the  underlying  invoices  of  the 
selected  samples,  verifying  attributes  such  as  price, 
quantity, discount, weight, customer acknowledgement 
and making charges.

 We  tested  credit  notes  issued  to  retail  customers 
selected  using  statistical  sampling  on  sales  return 
during the year and subsequent to the year end.

 For  sales  (other  than  retail  sales),  we  performed 
substantive  testing  using  statistical  sampling  on  sales 
invoices  and  tested  the  underlying  documentation 
including verification of invoices, proof of delivery and 
collections thereon.

 We tested sales transactions using statistical sampling 
on sales (where applicable) made immediately pre and 
post year end, agreed the period of revenue recognition 
to the underlying documents.

Inventories

See Note 2(x) and Note 10 to standalone financial statements

The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

The  Company’s  inventories  primarily  comprise  high  value 
items  like  jewellery  (gold,  diamonds,  gemstones  etc.)  and 
watches. The Company holds inventory at various locations 
including  factories,  stores  (retail  outlets)  and  third-party 
locations.

There is a significant risk of loss of inventory given the high 
value and nature of the inventory involved.

In view of the above, we have identified existence of physical 
inventories as a key audit matter.

In  view  of  the  significance  of  the  matter  we  applied  the 
following  audit  procedures  in  this  area,  among  others,  to 
obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence:

• 

• 

 We evaluated. and tested the design, implementation 
and  the  operating  effectiveness  of  key  controls  that 
the  Company  has  in  relation  to  the  safeguarding 
and  physical  verification  of  inventory  including  the 
appropriateness of the Company’s standard operating 
procedures  for  conducting,  recording  and  reconciling 
physical  verification  of  inventories  and  tested  the 
implementation thereof.

 We evaluated the design, implementation and operating 
effectiveness of general IT controls and key application 
controls  over  the  Company’s  IT  systems  including 
those  relating  to  recording  of  inventory  quantities 
on  occurrence  of  each  transaction,  including  access 
controls,  controls  over  program  changes,  interfaces 
between different systems.

•

• 

 For the locations selected using statistical sampling we 
attended  physical  verification  of  inventory  conducted 
by the Company and tested roll-forward/roll-backward 
working  provided  by  the  management  as  at  the  year 
end,  where  applicable.  We  also  performed  physical 
verification  of 
inventory  selected  using  statistical 
sampling  and  checked  reconciliation  of  inventories  as 
per physical inventory verification and book records for 
the locations.

 We  performed  surprise  stock  count  at  stores  selected 
using random sampling.

 We obtained independent confirmations of inventories 
held  with  third  parties  for  samples  selected  using 
statistical sampling.

 We verified the purity of gold content using Karatmeter 
along with hallmarking embossed in the jewellery items 
and  originality  of  solitaires  and  small  diamonds  using 
diamond tester of the samples selected as part of year 
end physical verification process, as applicable.

Management’s  and  Board  of  Directors’/Board 
of  Trustees’  Responsibilities  for  the  Standalone 
Financial Statements

in 

India, 

The  Company’s  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  are 
responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the 
Act  with  respect  to  the  preparation  of  these  standalone 
financial  statements  that  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of 
the  state  of  affairs,  profit/loss  and  other  comprehensive 
income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company 
in  accordance  with  the  accounting  principles  generally 
accepted 
Indian  Accounting 
including  the 
Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. 
This  responsibility  also  includes  maintenance  of  adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the 
Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for 
preventing  and  detecting  frauds  and  other  irregularities; 
selection  and  application  of  appropriate  accounting 
judgments  and  estimates  that  are 
policies;  making 
reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and 
maintenance  of  adequate  internal  financial  controls,  that 
were  operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  accuracy  and 
completeness  of  the  accounting  records,  relevant  to  the 
preparation  and  presentation  of  the  standalone  financial 
statements that give a true and fair view and are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Other Information

The  Company’s  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises the information included in the Company’s annual 
report,  but  does  not  include  the  financial  statements  and 
auditor’s  report(s)  thereon.  The  Company’s  annual  report  is 
expected  to  be  made  available  to  us  after  the  date  of  this 
auditor’s report.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not e press any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.

In  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  standalone  financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified  above  when  it  becomes  available  and,  in  doing 
so,  consider  whether  the  other  information  is  materially 
inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.

When we read the Company’s annual report, if we conclude 
that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required 
to communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.

260

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDIn  preparing  the  standalone  financial  statements,  the 
Management  and  Board  of  Directors/Board  of  Trustees  are 
responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as 
a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting 
unless the Board of Directors/Board of Trustees either intends 
to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so.

• 

• 

The Board of Directors/Board of Trustees is also responsible 
for  overseeing  the  Company’s/Trust’s  financial  reporting 
process.

Auditor’s  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the 
Standalone Financial Statements

Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about 
whether  the  standalone  financial  statements  as  a  whole 
are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud 
or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditor’s  report  that  includes  our 
opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with  SAs  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when 
it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and 
are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic 
decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  standalone 
financial statements.

As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  SAs,  we  exercise 
professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:

• 

• 

 Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement 
of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  whether  due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 
responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence 
that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis 
for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material 
misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or 
the override of internal control.

 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and 
related disclosures made by the Management and Board 
of Directors.

 Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of  accounting  in  preparation  of  standalone  financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the 
Company’s  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If 
we  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we 
are  required  to  draw  attention  in  our  auditor’s  report 
to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  standalone  financial 
statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate,  to 
modify  our  opinion.  Our  conclusions  are  based  on  the 
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s 
report. However, future events or conditions may cause 
the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

• 

 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of  the  standalone  financial  statements,  including  the 
disclosures,  and  whether  the  standalone  financial 
statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance 
regarding,  among  other  matters,  the  planned  scope  and 
timing  of  the  audit  and  significant  audit  findings,  including 
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify 
during our audit.

We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a 
statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 
with  them  all  relationships  and  other  matters  that  may 
reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our  independence,  and 
where applicable, related safeguards.

From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with 
governance, we determine those matters that were of most 
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements 
of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. 
We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law 
or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or 
when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a 
matter  should  not  be  communicated  in  our  report  because 
the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected  to  outweigh  the  public  interest  benefits  of  such 
communication.

(d) 

 According  to  the  information  and  explanations 
given  to  us  and  on  the  basis  of  our  examination 
of the records of the Company, the Company has 
a regular programme of physical verification of its 
Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  and  Right  of  Use 
asset by which all factory related assets are verified 
every  year  and  non-  factory  related  assets  are 
verified in a phased manner over a period of three 
years. In accordance with this programme, certain 
property,  plant  and  equipment  were  verified 
during the year. In our opinion, this periodicity of 
physical  verification  is  reasonable  having  regard 
to  the  size  of  the  Company  and  the  nature  of  its 
assets. No material discrepancies were noticed on 
such verification.

 According  to  the  information  and  explanations 
given  to  us  and  on  the  basis  of  our  examination 
of  the  records  of  the  Company,  the  title  deeds 
of  immovable  properties  (other  than  immovable 
properties  where  the  Company  is  the  lessee  and 
the leases agreements are duly executed in favour 
of the lessee) disclosed in the standalone financial 
statements are held in the name of the Company.

given  to  us  and  on  the  basis  of  our  examination

given  to  us  and  on  the  basis  of  our  examination 
of  the  records  of  the  Company,  there  are  no 

proceedings  initiated  or  pending  against  the 
Company for holding any benami property under 
the  Prohibition  of  Benami  Property  Transactions 
Act, 1988 and rules made thereunder.

 The  inventory,  except  goods-in-transit,  has  been 
physically verified by the management during the 
year.  For  goods-in-transit  subsequent  evidence  of 
receipts  has  been  linked  with  inventory  records. 
In  our  opinion,  the  frequency  of  such  verification 
is  reasonable  and  procedures  and  coverage  as 
followed  by  management  were  appropriate.  No 
discrepancies were noticed on verification between 
the physical stocks and the book records that were 
more than 10% in the aggregate of each class of 
inventory

and  financial  institutions  on  the  basis  of  security

applicable to the Company.

to  financial  statements  of  Titan  Company  Limited  (“the 
Company”)  as  of  31  March  2025  in  conjunction  with  our 
audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company 
for the year ended on that date.

Management’s 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls

Board 

of  Directors’ 

and 

The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial 
controls based on the internal financial controls with reference 
to  financial  statements  criteria  established  by  the  Company 
considering  the  essential  components  of  internal  control 
stated  in  the  Guidance  Note  on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial 
Controls  Over  Financial  Reporting  issued  by  the  Institute 
of  Chartered  Accountants  of  India  (the  “Guidance  Note”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were 
operating  effectively  for  ensuring  the  orderly  and  efficient 
conduct  of  its  business,  including  adherence  to  company’s 
policies,  the  safeguarding  of  its  assets,  the  prevention  and 
detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness 
of  the  accounting  records,  and  the  timely  preparation  of 
reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  financial 
statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  in 
accordance  with  the  Guidance  Note  and  the  Standards  on 
Auditing,  prescribed  under  Section  143(10)  of  the  Act,  to 
the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls 
with  reference  to  financial  statements.  Those  Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain 
reasonable  assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements were 
established  and  maintained  and  if  such  controls  operated 
effectively in all material respects.

270

Our  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit 
evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls 
with  reference  to  financial  statements  and  their  operating 
effectiveness.  Our  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with 
reference  to  financial  statements  included  obtaining  an 
understanding  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference 
to  financial  statements,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material 
weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design 
and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on 
the  assessed  risk.  The  procedures  selected  depend  on  the 
auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error.

We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained  is 
sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  audit 
opinion  on  the  Company’s  internal  financial  controls  with 
reference to financial statements.

Meaning  of 
Reference to Financial Statements

Internal  Financial  Controls  with 

A  company’s  internal  financial  controls  with  reference 
to  financial  statements  is  a  process  designed  to  provide 
reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial 
reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for 
external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted 
accounting principles. A company’s internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements include those policies 
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) 
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles, 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being 
made only in accordance with authorisations of management 
and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable 
assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely  detection  of 
unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s 
assets  that  could  have  a  material  effect  on  the  financial 
statements.

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements

Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management  override 
of  controls,  material  misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud 
may  occur  and  not  be  detected.  Also,  projections  of  any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion

effectively  as  at  31  March  2025,  based  on  the  internal 
financial  controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements 
criteria established by the Company considering the essential 
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note.

2.  Material Accounting Policies

 This note provides a list of material accounting policies 
adopted in the preparation of the standalone financial 
statements.  These  policies  have  been  consistently 
applied  to  all  the  years  presented,  unless  otherwise 
stated.  These  standalone  financial  statements  are  the 
separate financial statements of the Company.

Basis of preparation

i. 

Statement of compliance

Indian  Accounting  Standard 

 The  standalone  financial  statements  of 
the 
Company  have  been  prepared  in  accordance 
(“Ind  AS”) 
with 
notified  under  the  Companies  (Indian  Accounting 
Standards)  Rules,  2015  as  amended  from  time  to 
time, read with section 133 of the Companies Act, 
2013  (“the  Act”)  and  other  relevant  provisions  of 
the Act.

ii.  Basis of measurement

 These  standalone  financial  statements  have  been 
prepared  on  an  accrual  basis  under  the  historical 
cost convention except for the following assets and 
liabilities which have been measured at fair value:

a) 

b) 

 Certain  financial  assets  and 
(including derivative instruments)

liabilities 

 The  defined  benefit  asset/(liability) 
is 
recognised  as  the  present  value  of  defined 
benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets

 Historical cost is generally based on the fair value 
of  the  consideration  given  in  exchange  for  goods 
and  services.  Fair  value  is  the  price  that  would 
be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a 

278

liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market 
participants at the measurement date.

iii.  Current/non-current classification

 Based  on  the  time  involved  between  acquisition 
of  assets  for  processing  and  their  realization  in 
cash  and  cash  equivalents,  the  Company  has 
identified twelve months as its operating cycle for 
determining current and non-current classification 
of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.

iv.  Rounding of amounts

 All amount disclosed in these standalone financial 
statements  and  notes  have  been  rounded  off  to  
`  crore  as  per  the  requirement  of  Schedule  III, 
unless otherwise stated. Transactions and balances 
with values below the rounding off norm adopted 
by the Company have been reflected as “0” in the 
relevant notes to these financial statements.

v.  Use of estimates and judgement

 The preparation of standalone financial statements 
in  conformity  with  Ind  AS  requires  management 
to  make  judgements,  estimates  and  assumptions 
that  affect  the  application  of  accounting  policies 
and the reported amount of assets and liabilities, 
revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent 
liabilities.  Such  estimates  and  assumptions  are 
based  on  management’s  evaluation  of  relevant 
facts and circumstances as on the date of financial 
statements. The actual outcome may diverge from 
these estimates.

 Estimates  and  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  a 
periodic  basis.  Revisions  to  accounting  estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimates 
are revised and in any future periods affected.

  Assumptions and estimation

 Information  about  assumptions  and  estimation 
uncertainties that have significant risk of resulting 
in  a  material  adjustment  in  the  year  ending  
31st March 2025 is included in the following notes:

measurement of financial instruments

vi.  Functional and presentation currency

 Items  included  in  the  financial  statements  of  the 
Company  are  measured  using  the  currency  of 
the  primary  economic  environment  in  which  the 
Company operates (i.e. the “functional currency”). 
The  financial  statements  are  presented  in  Indian 
Rupee, the national currency of India, which is the 
functional currency of the Company. All amounts 
have been rounded-off to the nearest crore, unless 
otherwise indicated.

vii.  Measurement of fair values

 Certain accounting policies and disclosures of the 
Company require the measurement of fair values, 
for  both  financial  and  non-financial  assets  and 
liabilities.

 The Company has an established control framework 
with respect to the measurement of fair values and 
the  valuation  team  regularly  reviews  significant 
unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments.

 Fair values are categorised into different levels in a 
fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the 
valuation techniques as follows:

- 

- 

 Level  1:  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities

 Level  2:  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices 
included in Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)

- 

 Level  3:  inputs  for  the  asset  or  liability  that 
are  not  based  on  observable  market  data 
(unobservable inputs)

 When  measuring  the  fair  value  of  an  asset  or  a 
liability, the Company uses observable market data 
as  far  as  possible.  If  the  inputs  used  to  measure 
the  fair  value  of  an  asset  or  a  liability  fall  into 
different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the 
fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety 
in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the 
lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  entire 
measurement.

 Further  information  about  the  assumptions  made 
in  the  measuring  fair  values  is  included  in  the 
following notes:

- 

- 

Note 5 - Investment property

Note 34 - Financial Instruments.

viii.  Foreign Currency

 In preparing the standalone financial statements of 
the Company, transactions in currencies other than 
the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) 
are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing 
at the date of the transaction. At the end of each 
reporting  period,  monetary  items  denominated 
in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  at  the  rates 
prevailing  at  that  date.  Non-monetary  items  that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign 
currency  are  not  translated.  Exchange  differences 
on monetary items are recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss in the period in which they arise. 
except  for  exchange  differences  on  transactions 
designated as cash flow hedge.

ix.  Revenue and other income recognition

 The Company recognises revenue when the control 
of goods being sold is transferred to the customer 
and  when  there  are  no  longer  any  unfulfilled 
obligations.  The  performance  obligations  in  the 
contracts  are  fulfilled  based  on  various  customer 
terms  including  at  the  time  of  delivery  of  goods, 
dispatch  or  upon  customer  acceptance  based  on 
various  distribution  channels.  The  Company  has 
generally  concluded  that  it  is  the  principal  in  its

revenue arrangements, because it typically controls 
the goods or services before transferring them to 
the customer.

a) 

 Sale  of  goods:  Revenue  from  the  sale  of 
products  is  recognised  at  the  point  in  time 
when  control  of  the  goods  is  transferred  to 
the customer.

is  measured  based  on 

the 
 Revenue 
transaction price, which is the consideration, 
net of customer incentives, discounts, variable 
considerations, payments made to customers, 
other  similar  charges,  as  specified  in  the 
contract  with  the  customer.  Additionally, 
revenue  excludes 
from 
customers,  which  are  subsequently  remitted 
to  governmental  authorities.  Accruals  for 
returns  are  estimated  (using  the  most  likely 
method)  based  on  accumulated  experience 
and agreements with customers.

taxes  collected 

 Contract  assets  are  recognised  when  there 
is  excess  of  revenue  earned  over  billings  on 
contracts.  Contract  assets  are  classified  as 
unbilled  receivables  (only  act  of  invoicing  is 
pending)  when  there  is  unconditional  right 
to  receive  cash,  and  only  passage  of  time  is 
required,  as  per  contractual  terms.  Other 
contract assets are classified as other assets. 
Unearned  and  deferred  revenue  (“contract 
liability”) is recognised when there is billings 
in excess of revenues. Advances received for 
services  are  reported  as  liabilities  until  all 
conditions for revenue recognition are met.

Barter Transactions

 The  Company  has  entered 
into  barter 
arrangements  with  certain  media  and 
advertising  agencies,  where  products  are 
provided 
in  exchange  for  advertisement 
services. These transactions are recognized in 
accordance  with  Ind  AS  115-  Revenue  from 
contracts  with  customers  considering  the 
following:

• 

contracts  were 

 The 
enforceable, 
approved  by  both  parties,  and  had 
commercial substance

280

• 

• 

 The  Company  transferred  control  of 
goods  to  the  counterparty,  satisfying 
performance obligations

 Revenue  was  recognized  based  on  the 
fair value of the merchandise provided

Customer loyalty programmes

 The  Company  has  a  customer 
loyalty 
programme  for  selected  customers.  The 
Company  grants  credit  points  to  those 
customers as part of a sales transaction which 
allows them to accumulate and redeem those 
credit  points.  The  consideration  is  allocated 
between  the  loyalty  programme  and  the 
goods  based  on  their  relative  standalone 
selling  prices.  The  credit  points  have  been 
deferred  and  will  be  recognised  as  revenue 
when  the  reward  points  are  redeemed  or 
lapsed.

Service 

income: 

 Service 
is 
recognised  on  rendering  of  services  based 
on  the  agreements/arrangements  with  the 
concerned parties.

income 

interest 

 Dividend  and 
income:  Dividend 
income from investments is recognised when 
the  Company’s  right  to  receive  the  payment 
has  been  established  i.e.,  either  when  the 
dividend  is  declared  or  when  shareholders 
approve  the  dividend  in  case  of  equity 
investments.

 For  all  financial  instruments  measured  at 
amortised  cost,  interest  income  is  recorded 
using the effective interest rate (EIR), which is 
the rate that exactly discounts the estimated 
future  cash  payments  or  receipts  over  the 
expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument  or 
a  shorter  period,  where  appropriate,  to  the 
net  carrying  amount  of  the  financial  asset. 
Interest income is included in other income in 
the Statement of profit and loss.

b) 

c) 

  Other Operating Income:

 Indirect  tax  incentives  are  recognised  when 
the  right  to  receive  the  amount  as  per  the 
terms  of  scheme  is  established  in  respect  of 
industrial promotion scheme applicable to the 
respective units.

 Use  of  significant  judgements  in  revenue 
recognition:

a) 

b) 

c) 

 The  Company’s  contracts  with  customers 
could  include  promises  to  transfer  multiple 
goods to a customer. The Company assesses 
the  goods  promised 
in  a  contract  and 
identifies  distinct  performance  obligations 
in  the  contract.  Identification  of  distinct 
performance  obligation  involves  judgement 
to  determine  the  deliverables  and  the  ability 
of  the  customer  to  benefit  independently 
from such deliverables.

 Judgement  is  also  required  to  determine 
the  transaction  price  for  the  contract.  The 
transaction  price  could  be  either  a  fixed 
amount of customer consideration or variable 
consideration  with  elements  such  as  volume 
discounts,  performance  bonuses,  price 
concessions  and  incentives.  The  transaction 
price  is  also  adjusted  for  the  effects  of  the 
time value of money if the contract includes 
a  significant  financing  component.  Any 
consideration  payable  to  the  customer  is 
adjusted  to  the  transaction  price,  unless  it 
is  a  payment  for  a  distinct  good  from  the 
customer.  The  estimated  amount  of  variable 
consideration  is  adjusted  in  the  transaction 
price  only  to  the  extent  that  it  is  highly 
probable  that  a  significant  reversal  in  the 
amount of cumulative revenue recognised will 
not occur and is reassessed at the end of each 
reporting period.

 The  Company  uses  judgement  to  determine 
an  appropriate  standalone  selling  price  for 
a  performance  obligation.  The  Company 
allocates  the  transaction  price  to  each 
performance  obligation  on  the  basis  of  the 
relative  stand-alone  selling  price  of  each 
distinct  good  or  service  promised  in  the 
contract. Where standalone selling price is not 
observable,  the  Company  uses  the  expected 
cost  plus  margin  approach  to  allocate  the 
transaction price to each distinct performance 
obligation.

 Commission  income  is  generally  recognised 
when the related sale is executed as per the 
terms of the agreement.

 The  Company  has  determined  that  the 
revenues  as  disclosed 
in  Note  19  are 
disaggregated into categories that depict how 
the  nature,  amount,  timing  and  uncertainty 
of  revenue  and  cash  flows  are  affected  by 
economic factors.

x. 

Inventories

 Inventories [other than quantities of gold for which 
the price is yet to be determined with the suppliers 
(Unfixed gold) or where hedge contracts have been 
entered into for quantities of gold and accounted 
for as fair value hedge] are stated at the lower of 
cost  and  net  realisable  value  determined  on  an 
item-by-item basis. Cost is determined as follows:

a) 

 Gold is valued on first-in-first-out basis

b) 

c) 

 Stores  and  spares,  loose  tools  and  raw 
materials  are  valued  on  a  moving  weighted 
average rate

 Work-in-progress  and  finished  goods  (other 
than gold) are valued on full absorption cost 
method based on the moving average cost of 
production

d) 

 Traded  goods  are  valued  on  a  moving 
weighted average rate/cost of purchases 

 Cost  comprises  all  costs  of  purchase 
including  duties  and  taxes  (other  than  those 
subsequently  recoverable  by  the  Company), 
freight inwards and other expenditure directly 
attributable to acquisition. Work-in- progress 
include  appropriate 
and  finished  goods 
proportion  of  overheads  and,  where 
applicable, other taxes.

 Unfixed  gold  and  quantities  of  gold  covered 
under fair value hedge is valued at gold prices 
prevailing  on  the  period  closing  date.  Gold 
quantities  other  than  unfixed  and  covered 
through fair value hedge is valued on first-in-
first-out basis. Net realisable value represents 
the  estimated  selling  price  for  inventories 
less estimated costs of completion and costs 
necessary to make the sale. The net realisable 
value of work-in- progress is determined with 
reference to the selling prices of related finished

goods.  Raw  materials,  components  and 
other supplies held for use in the production 
of  finished  products  are  not  written  down 
below cost except in cases when a decline in 
the  price  of  materials  indicates  that  the  cost 
of the finished products shall exceed the net 
realisable value. The comparison of cost and 
net  realisable  value  is  made  on  an  item-by-
item basis.

xi.  Property, Plant and Equipment

a)  Recognition and measurement:

 Land  and  buildings  held  for  use  in  the 
production  or  supply  of  goods  or  services, 
or  for  administrative  purposes,  are  stated 
at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and 
accumulated 
losses.  Freehold 
land is not depreciated.

impairment 

 Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  carried 
at  cost 
less  accumulated  depreciation 
and  impairment  losses,  if  any.  The  cost  of 
property,  plant  and  equipment  comprises 
its  purchase  price/acquisition  cost,  net 
of  any  trade  discounts  and  rebates,  any 
import  duties  and  other  taxes  (other  than 
those  subsequently  recoverable  from  the 
tax  authorities),  any  directly  attributable 
expenditure  on  making  the  asset  ready  for 
its  intended  use,  other  incidental  expenses 
and 
interest  on  borrowings  attributable 
to  acquisition  of  qualifying  property,  plant 
and  equipment  up  to  the  date  the  asset  is 
ready  for  its  intended  use.  Machine  spare 
parts  are  recognised  in  accordance  with  this 
Ind  AS  when  they  meet  the  definition  of 
property,  plant  and  equipment,  otherwise, 
such 
inventory. 
Subsequent  expenditure  on  property,  plant 
and equipment after its purchase/completion 
is capitalised only if such expenditure results 
in an increase in the future benefits from such 
asset beyond its previously assessed standard 
of performance and the cost of item can be 
measured reliably.

items  are  classified  as 

 The estimated useful life of the tangible assets 
and the useful life are reviewed at the end of 

282

the  each  financial  year  and  the  depreciation 
period  is  revised  to  reflect  the  changed 
pattern, if any.

 An  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment 
is  derecognised  upon  disposal  or  when  no 
future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from continued use of the asset. Any gain or 
loss  arising  on  the  disposal  or  retirement  of 
an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is 
determined  as  the  difference  between  the 
sales  proceeds  and  the  carrying  amount  of 
the asset and is recognised in the statement 
of profit and loss.

b)  Depreciation

 Depreciable  amount  for  assets  is  the  cost  of 
an  asset,  or  other  substituted  for  cost,  less 
its  estimated  residual  value.  Depreciation  is 
calculated on the basis of the estimated useful 
lives  using  the  straight  line  method  and  is 
generally recognised in the statement of profit 
and  loss.  Depreciation  for  assets  purchased/
sold during the year is proportionately charged 
from/upto  the  date  of  disposal.  However, 
leasehold  improvements  are  depreciated  on 
a  straight-line  method  over  the  shorter  of 
their  respective  useful  lives  or  the  tenure  of 
the lease arrangement. Free hold land is not 
depreciated.

 The  estimated  useful 
items  of 
property, plant and equipment for the current 
and comparative periods are as follows:

evaluation, 

the 
 Based 
management  believes  that  its  estimates  of 
useful  lives  as  given  above  represents  the 
period  over  which  the  management  expects 
to use these assets.

 When  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant 
and  equipment  have  different  useful  lives, 
they  are  accounted  for  as  separate  items 
(major  components)  of  property,  plant  and 
equipment.  Repairs  and  maintenance  costs 
are  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit 
and loss when incurred. The cost and related 
accumulated  depreciation  are  eliminated 
from  the  financial  statements  upon  sale  or 
disposition of the asset and the resultant gains 
or  losses  are  recognised  in  the  statement  of 
profit and loss.

assets outstanding at each balance sheet date

 The  cost  property,  plant  and  equipment,  at  
1st  April  2016,  the  Company’s  date  of 
transition  to  Ind  AS,  was  determined  with 
reference  to  its  carrying  value  recognised  as 
per  the  previous  GAAP  (deemed  cost),  as  at 
the date of transition to Ind AS.

xii.  Leases

 The  Company  assesses  at  contract 
inception 
whether  a  contract  is,  or  contains,  a  lease  i.e.,  if 
the  contract  conveys  the  right  to  control  the  use 
of an identified asset for a period in exchange of 
consideration.

Company as a Lessee

 The  Company  applies  a  single  recognition  and 
measurement  approach  for  all  leases  except  for 
short-term  leases.  The  Company  recognises  lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use 

assets representing the right to use the underlying 
assets.  The  nature  of  expenses  related  to  those 
leases  has  changed  from  lease  rent  in  previous 
periods  to  (i)  amortization  for  the  right-to-use 
asset, and (ii) interest accrued on lease liability.

a) 

Right-of-use assets:

 Right-of-use  assets  are  measured  at  cost 
comprising the following:

i) 

 the  amount  of  the  initial  measurement 
of lease liability

ii) 

any initial direct costs

iii) 

restoration costs

 Right-of-use  assets  are  depreciated  over  the 
lease term on a straight-line basis.

b) 

Lease Liabilities:

 Lease liabilities are measured at present value 
of following components:

i) 

ii) 

 fixed payments less any lease incentives 
receivable

 amounts expected to be payable by the 
Company under residual value guarantee

rate  used 

 Incremental  borrowing 
for 
discounting  has  been  determined  by  taking 
the  interest  rates  obtained  from  financial 
institutions  for  borrowing  the  similar  value 
of  right  of  use  assets  for  similar  tenure.  The 
rates  will  be  reassessed  on  a  yearly  basis  at 
the  beginning  of  each  accounting  period  to 
reflect changes in financial conditions.

c) 

Short-term leases:

 The  Company  applies  the  short-term  lease 
recognition  exemption  to 
its  short-term 
lease  contracts  (i.e.  those  leases  that  have 
a  lease  term  of  12  months  or  less  from  the 
commencement  date  and  do  not  contain  a 
purchase option). Lease payments on a short-
term  leases  are  recognised  as  expense  on  a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.

d)  Variable payments:

 Variable lease payments that depend on sales 
are  recognised  in  the  Statement  of  profit  or 
loss in the period in which the condition that 
triggers those payments occurs.

e)  Modification/termination of lease:

 The  lease  liability  is  measured  at  amortised 
cost  using  the  effective  interest  method. 
It  is  remeasured  when  there  is  a  change  in 
future lease payments arising from a change 
in  an  index  or  rate,  if  there  is  a  change  in 
the  estimate  of  the  amount  expected  to  be 
payable  under  a  residual  value  guarantee, 
if  the  Company  changes  its  assessment 
of  whether 
it  will  exercise  a  purchase, 
extension or termination option or if there is 
a  revised  in-substance  fixed  lease  payment. 
A  corresponding  adjustment  is  made  to  the 
carrying  amount  of  the  right-  of-use  asset, 
or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying 
amount  of  the  right-of-use  asset  has  been 
reduced to zero.

Company as a Lessor:

 In case of sub-leasing, where the Company, being 
the original lessee and intermediate lessor, grants 
a right to use the underlying asset to a third party, 
the  head  lease  is  recognised  as  lease  liability  and 
sub-lease is recognised as lease receivables in the 
Balance Sheet of the Company. Interest expense is 
charged on the lease liability and interest income is 
recognised on lease receivables in the statement of 
profit or loss.

xiii.  Investment property

 Investment  properties  are  properties  held  to  earn 
rentals and/or for capital appreciation. Investment 
properties are measured initially at cost, including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment properties are measured in accordance 
with Ind AS 16’s requirements for cost model.

 An  investment  property  is  derecognised  upon 
disposal or when there is a change in use or when 
the investment property is permanently withdrawn 

from  use  and  no  future  economic  benefits  are 
expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising 
on derecognition of the property (calculated as the 
difference between the net disposal proceeds and 
the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the 
statement of profit or loss in the period in which 
the property is derecognised.

 The  investment  property  includes  only  land  held 
by the Company and accordingly no amortization 
of  the  investment  property  is  recorded  in  the 
statement of profit and loss.

 The  fair  values  of  the  investment  property  are 
disclosed in the notes. Fair values is determined by 
an independent valuer who holds a recognised and 
relevant  professional  qualification  and  has  recent 
experience  in  the  location  and  category  of  the 
investment property being valued.

 The cost of Investment property at 1st April 2016, 
the  Group’s  date  of  transition  to  Ind  AS,  was 
determined  with  reference  to  its  carrying  value 
recognised  as  per  the  previous  GAAP  (deemed 
cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.

xiv.  Intangible assets

initial 

 Intangible assets acquired separately are measured 
on 
recognition  at  cost.  Subsequent 
expenditure  is  capitalized  only  when  it  increases 
the  future  economic  benefits  attributable  to  the 
asset will flow to the Company and the cost of asset 
can be measured reliably. All other expenditure is 
recognized in profit or loss as incurred.

 Intangible  assets  are  subsequently  stated  at  cost 
less  accumulated  amortisation  and  impairment. 
Intangible assets are amortised over their respective 
estimated  useful  lives  on  a  straight  line  basis, 
from the date that they are available for use. The 
estimated  useful  life  of  an  identifiable  intangible 
assets  is  based  on  a  number  of  factors  including 
the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition 
and  other  economic  factors  (such  as  the  stability 
of the industry and known technological advances) 
and the level of maintenance expenditures required 
to obtain the expected future cash flows from the 
asset.

as follows:

 Computer  software  -  License  period  or  5  years, 
whichever is lower. 

Intellectual properties - 5 years

Patents - 5 years 

Trademarks - Infinite life

 The  estimated  useful  life  of  the  intangible  assets 
and  the  amortisation  period  are  reviewed  at  the 
end of the each financial year and the amortisation 
period is revised to reflect the changed pattern, if 
any.

 Intangibles  under  development  includes  cost  of 
intangible  assets  under  development  as  at  the 
balance sheet date.

 Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it 
increases  the  future  economic  benefits  embodied 
in the specific asset to which it relates.

 The  cost  of  Intangible  assets  at  1st  April  2016, 
the  Group’s  date  of  transition  to  Ind  AS,  was 
determined  with  reference  to  its  carrying  value 
recognised  as  per  the  previous  GAAP  (deemed 
cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.

xv. 

Impairment

Impairment of financial assets:

 The Company recognises loss allowances using the 
expected  credit  loss  (ECL)  model  for  the  financial 
assets  which  are  not  fair  valued  through  profit 
or  loss.  Loss  allowance  for  trade  receivables  with 
no  significant  financing  component  is  measured 
at  an  amount  equal  to  life  time  ECL.  For  all 
other  financial  assets,  expected  credit  losses  are 
measured  at  an  amount  equal  to  the  12-month 
ECL,  unless  there  has  been  a  significant  increase 
in credit risk from initial recognition in which case 
those are measured at lifetime ECL. The Company 
evaluates a significant increase in credit risk based 
on  quantitative  and  qualitative  indicators  such  as 
overdue  status,  deterioration  in  credit  rating,  and 
adverse changes in business or economic conditions 
The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) 
that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the 
reporting date to the amount that is required to be 
recognised is recognised as an impairment gain or 
loss in the statement of profit and loss.

Impairment of non-financial assets:

 At  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  the 
Company  reviews  the  carrying  amounts  of  non-
financial  assets  (other  than  investment  property, 
inventories, contract asset and deferred tax assets) 
to determine whether there is any indication that 
those  assets  have  suffered  an  impairment  loss.  If 
any such indication exists, the recoverable amount 
of the assets is estimated in order to determine the 
extent  of  the  impairment  loss  (if  any).  When  it  is 
not  possible  to  estimate  the  recoverable  amount 
of an individual asset, the Company estimates the 
recoverable  amount  of  the  cash-generating  unit 
to which the assets are also allocated to individual 
cash-generating  units,  or  otherwise  they  are 
allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating 
units  for  which  a  reasonable  and  consistent 
allocation basis can be identified.

 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs  of  disposal  and  value  in  use.  In  assessing 
value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are 
discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre-
tax  discount  rate  that  reflects  current  market 
assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the 
risks  specific  to  the  asset  for  which  estimates  of 
future cash flows have not been adjusted.

 If  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  (or  cash 
generating  unit)  is  estimated  to  be  less  than  its 
carrying  amount,  the  carrying  amount  of  the 
asset  (or  cash  generating  unit)  is  reduced  to 
its  recoverable  amount.  An  impairment  loss  is 
recognised immediately in the statement of profit 
and loss.

 When  an  impairment  loss  subsequently  reverses, 
(or  cash 
the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset 
generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased 
carrying  amount  does  not  exceed  the  carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or 
cash  generating  unit)  in  prior  years.  A  reversal  of 
impairment  loss  is  recognised  immediately  in  the 
statement of profit and loss.

 Investment  in  subsidiaries,  associate  and  joint

impairment.

xvii. Financial instruments

Recognition of financial assets:

liabilities  are 
 Financial  assets  and  financial 
recognised when the Company becomes a party to 
the contractual provisions of the instruments.

 A  financial  asset  (unless  it  is  a  trade  receivable 
without  a  significant  financing  component)  or 
financial  liability  is  initially  measured  at  fair  value 
plus. Transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to  financial  assets  and  liabilities  [other  than 
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
through  profit  and  loss  (FVTPL)]  are  added  to  or 
deducted from the fair value of the financial assets 
or  liabilities,  as  appropriate  on  initial  recognition. 
Transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition 
of financial assets or liabilities measured at FVTPL 
are  recognised  immediately  in  the  statement  of 
profit and loss.

 A  trade  receivable  without  a  significant  financing 
component is initially measured at the transaction 
price.

 All  regular  way  purchases  or  sales  of  financial 
assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade 
date  basis.  Regular  way  purchases  or  sales  are 
purchases  or  sales  of  financial  assets  that  require 
delivery of assets within the time frame established 
by regulation or convention in market place.

 All  recognised  financial  assets  are  subsequently 
measured in their entirety at either amortised cost 
or  fair  value,  depending  on  the  classification  of 
financial assets.

  A)  Financial Assets 

Classification of financial assets:

 On  initial  recognition,  a  financial  asset  is 
classified at

(i)  Amortised cost

286

(ii) 

 Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)

(iii)  Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)

 Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their initial recognition, except if and in the 
period the group changes its business model 
for managing financial assets.

i)  Financial assets at amortised cost:

 A  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortised 
cost  if  both  of  the  following  conditions  are 
met:

a) 

b) 

 the  financial  asset  is  held  within  a 
business  model  whose  objective  is  to 
hold  financial  assets  in  order  to  collect 
contractual cash flows; and

 the  contractual  terms  of  the  financial 
asset  give  rise  on  specified  dates  to 
cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments 
of  principal  and  interest  (SPPI)  on  the 
principal amount outstanding.

 In  case  of  financial  assets  classified  and 
measured  at  amortised  cost,  any  interest 
income, foreign exchange gains or losses and 
impairment  are  recognised  in  the  Statement 
of Profit and Loss.

Effective interest method:

 The  effective  interest  method  is  a  method 
of  calculating  the  amortised  cost  of  a  debt 
instrument  and  of  allocating  interest  income 
over the relevant period. The effective interest 
rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future 
cash  receipts  through  the  expected  life  of 
the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on 
initial recognition.

 Income is recognised on an effective interest 
basis  for  debt  instruments  other  than  those 
financial assets. Interest income is recognised 
in profit or loss and is included in the “Other 
income” line item.

ii)   Investments in equity instruments at Fair 
Value  Through  Other  Comprehensive 
Income (FVTOCI)

 On initial recognition, the Company can make 
an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-
instrument  basis)  to  present  the  subsequent 
changes in fair value either in the statement 
of  profit  and  loss  or  in  other  comprehensive 
income  pertaining  to  equity  instruments. 
This  election  is  not  permitted  if  the  equity 
investment is held for trading. These elected 
investments  are  initially  measured  at  fair 
value  plus  transaction  costs.  Subsequently, 
they  are  measured  at  fair  value  with  gains 
and losses arising from changes in fair value 
recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income 
and  accumulated  in  the  ‘Reserve  for  equity 
instruments  through  other  comprehensive 
income’.  The  cumulative  gain  or  loss  is  not 
reclassified to the statement of profit and loss 
on disposal of the investment.

 Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair 
value at the end of each reporting period, with 
any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit  and 
loss.  The  net  gain  or  loss  recognised  in  the 
statement of profit and loss incorporates any 
dividend  or  interest  earned  on  the  financial 
asset  and  is  included  in  the  ‘Other  income’ 
line  item.  Dividend  on  financial  assets  at 
FVTPL  is  recognised  when  the  Company’s 
right  to  receive  the  dividend  is  established, 
it  is  probable  that  the  economic  benefits 
associated with the dividend will flow to the 
entity,  the  dividend  does  not  represent  a 
recovery of part of the cost of the investment 
and the amount of dividend can be measured 
reliably.

- 

A financial asset is derecognised only when

- 

- 

 The Company has transferred the rights 
to receive cash flows from the financial 
asset or

 retains  the  contractual  rights  to  receive 
the cash flows of the financial asset, but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay 
the cash flows to one or more recipients.

 When  the  entity  has  transferred  an  asset, 
it  has 
the  Company  evaluates  whether 
transferred substantially all risks and rewards 
of  ownership  of  the  financial  asset.  In  such 
cases, the financial asset is derecognised.

 Whether  the  entity  has  not  transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset, the financial asset is not 
derecognised.

 Where  the  entity  has  neither  transferred  a 
financial asset nor retains substantially all risks 
and  rewards  of  ownership  of  the  financial 
asset,  the  financial  asset  is  derecognised  if 
the Company has not retained control of the 
financial  asset.  When  the  Company  retains 
control  of  the  financial  asset,  the  asset  is 
continued  to  be  recognised  to  the  extent  of 
continuing involvement in the financial asset.

 Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition 
of the financial asset is recognised in the profit 
and loss statement.

f)  Foreign exchange gains and losses

in  a  foreign  currency  is  determined  in  that 
foreign  currency  and  translated  at  the  spot 
rate at the end of each reporting period.

financial  assets  measured  at  amortised 
cost and FVTPL, the exchange differences 
are recognised in the statement of profit 
and  loss  except  for  those  which  are 
designated as hedging instruments in a 
hedging relationship.

288

 For the purposes of recognising foreign 
exchange gains and losses, FVTOCI debt 
instruments  are  treated  as  financial 
assets  measured  at  amortised  cost. 
Thus,  the  exchange  differences  on  the 
amortised  cost  are  recognised  in  the 
statement  of  profit  and  loss  and  other 
changes  in  the  fair  value  of  FVTOCI 
financial  assets  are  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive income.

g)  Offsetting

 Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are 
offset  and  the  net  amount  presented  in  the 
balance  sheet  when,  and  only  when,  the 
Group currently has a legally enforceable right 
to  set  off  the  amounts  and  it  intends  either 
to settle them on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

 An  equity  instrument  is  any  contract  that 
evidences  a  residual  interest  in  the  assets  of

accounting policies set out below.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL

 A  financial  liability  is  classified  as  FVTPL  if 
it  is  classified  as  held-for-trading,  or  it  is  a 
derivative or it is designated as such in initial 
recognition.

subsequently 

 Financial  liabilities  that  are  not  held-for-
trading  and  are  not  designated  as  at  FVTPL 
are measured at amortised cost at the end of 
subsequent accounting periods. The carrying 
amounts  of  financial 
liabilities  that  are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost are 
determined  based  on  the  effective  interest 
method.

 The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating  the  amortised  cost  of  a  financial 
liability  and  of  allocating  interest  expense 
over  the  relevant  period.  The  effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated  future  cash  payments  through 
the  expected  life  of  the  financial  liability,  or 
(where  appropriate)  a  shorter  period,  to  the 
net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Foreign exchange gains and losses:

 For  financial  liabilities  that  are  denominated 
in  a  foreign  currency  and  are  measured  at 
amortised  cost  at  the  end  of  each  reporting 
period, the foreign exchange gains and losses 
are determined based on the amortised cost 
of the instruments and are recognised in the 
statement of profit and loss.

  Derecognition of financial liabilities:

 The Company derecognises financial liabilities 
when,  and  only  when,  the  Company’s 
obligations are discharged, cancelled or have 
expired.  An  exchange  with  a  lender  of  debt 
instruments with substantially different terms 
is accounted for as an extinguishment of the 
original  financial  liability  and  the  recognition 
of a new financial liability.

xvii. Derivative financial instruments

a)   Derivative instruments not designated as 
Cash flow hedges/Fair value hedges:

 The Company enters into a variety of derivative 
financial instruments to manage its exposure 
to  foreign  exchange  rate  risks,  including 
foreign  exchange  forward  contracts,  future 
contracts and Options.

 Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value 
at the date the derivative contracts are entered 
into and are subsequently remeasured to their 
fair value at the end of each reporting period. 
The  resulting  gain  or  loss  is  recognised  in 
the statement of profit and loss immediately 
unless  the  derivative 
is  designated  and 
effective  as  a  hedging  instrument,  in  which 
event  the  timing  of  the  recognition  in  profit 
or loss depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship  and  the  nature  of  the  hedged 
item.

instruments  to  manage  risks  associated  with 
gold  price  fluctuations  relating  to  certain 
transactions,

certain firm commitments. The Company has 
designated  derivative  financial  instruments

 The  use  of  derivative  financial  instruments 
is  governed  by  the  Company’s  policies 
approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  which 
provide written principles on the use of such 
instruments  consistent  with  the  Company’s 
risk management strategy.

 Hedging instruments are initially measured at 
fair value, and are re-measured at subsequent 
reporting  dates.  Changes  in  the  fair  value

 Hedge  accounting 
is  discontinued  when 
the  hedging  instrument  expires  or  is  sold,

terminated,  or  exercised,  or  no 
qualifies for hedge accounting. For forecasted 
transactions,  any  cumulative  gain  or  loss 
on  the  hedging  instrument  recognised  in 
hedging reserve is retained until the forecast 
transaction occurs upon which it is recognised 
in the statement of profit and loss. If a hedged 
transaction  is  no  longer  expected  to  occur, 
the  net  cumulative  gain  or  loss  accumulated 
in hedging reserve is recognised immediately 
to the statement of profit and loss.

 The  Company  has  designated  derivative 
financial  instruments  taken  for  gold  price

discontinued when the Company revokes the 
hedge relationship, the hedging instrument or 
hedged item expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised  or  no  longer  meets  the  criteria  for 
hedge accounting.

 The Company designates derivative contracts 
as  hedging  instruments  to  mitigate  the  risk 
of  change  in  fair  value  of  hedged  item  i.e. 
fixed gold inventory due to movement in gold 
prices.  The  Company  also  designated  the 
trade  payables  pertaining  to  gold  taken  on 
loan from banks (‘unfixed gold’) as a fair value 
hedge  to  the  corresponding  gold  inventory 
purchased on loan.

xix.  Employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits

 All short-term employee benefits such as salaries, 
wages, bonus, special awards and medical benefits 
which fall within 12 months of the period in which 
the employee renders related services which entitles 
them to avail such benefits and non-accumulating 
compensated  absences  are  recognised  on  an 
undiscounted basis and charged to the statement 
of profit and loss.

 A  liability  is  recognised  for  the  amount  expected 
to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-
sharing plans, if the Company has a present legal 
or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a 
result of past service provided by the employee and 
the obligation can be estimated reliably.

c) 

 Fair Value Hedge:

 With effect from 1st July 2021, the Company 
adopted  fair  value  hedge  for  the  derivative 
into  and  designated 
contracts  entered 

  Defined contribution plan

 The Company’s contributions to the Superannuation 
Fund  which  is  managed  by  a  Trust  and  Pension

Fund  administered  by  Regional  Provident  Fund 
Commissioner  and  Company’s  contribution  to 
National pension Scheme are charged as an expense 
based  on  the  amount  of  contribution  required  to 
be  made  and  when  services  are  rendered  by  the 
employees.

  Defined benefit plan

 The  contribution  to  the  Company’s  Gratuity  Trust 
and  liability  towards  pension  of  retired  managing 
directors  are  provided  using  the  projected  unit 
credit  method,  with  actuarial  valuations  being 
carried  out  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period. 
Remeasurement,  comprising  actuarial  gains  and 
losses  is  reflected  immediately  in  the  balance 
sheet  with  charge  or  credit  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive  income  in  the  period  in  which 
they  occur.  Remeasurement  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive  income  is  reflected  in  retained 
earnings and is not reclassified to the statement of 
profit and loss.

 The  contribution  to  the  Company’s  Provident 
Fund  Trust  is  made  at  predetermined  rates  and 
is  charged  as  an  expense  based  on  the  amount 
of  contribution  required  to  be  made  and  when 
services are rendered by the employees.

Compensated absences

 Compensated absences which are not expected to 
occur  within  twelve  months  after  the  end  of  the 
period in which the employee renders the related 
services are recognised as an actuarially determined 
liability at the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the balance sheet date.

xx.  Share based payment arrangements

 The  stock  options  granted  to  employees  in  terms 
of the Company’s Performance Based Stock Units 
Scheme,  are  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the 
options as on the grant date. The fair value of the 
options  is  accounted  as  employee  compensation 
cost over the vesting period on a straight-line basis 
based  on  the  fulfilment  of  the  probability  of  the 
performance  conditions.  The  amount  recognised 
as expense in each year is arrived at based on the 
number of grants expected to vest and if a grant 

lapses  after  the  vesting  period,  the  cumulative 
amount recognised as expense in respect of such 
grant is transferred to the retained earnings within 
equity. The fair value of the stock options granted 
to  employees  of  the  Company’s  subsidiaries  is 
accounted  as  a  recharge  and  recovered  from  the 
subsidiary.

 The  share-based  payment  equivalent  to  the  fair 
value  as  on  the  date  of  grant  of  employee  stock 
options  granted  to  key  managerial  personnel  is 
disclosed as a related party transaction in the year 
of grant.

 The  dilutive  effect  of  outstanding  options  is 
reflected  as  additional  share  dilution 
in  the 
computation of diluted earnings per share.

xxi.  Treasury share reserve

 The  Company’s  equity  shares  held  by  a  trust, 
which  is  consolidated  as  a  part  of  the  Company, 
are  classified  as  Treasury  shares.  Treasury  shares 
are  carried  at  acquisition  cost  and  presented 
as  a  deduction  from  total  equity  as  “Treasury 
share  reserve”.  As  and  when  treasury  shares 
are  transferred  to  employees  on  exercise  after 
satisfaction of the vesting conditions, the balance 
lying  in  “Treasury  share  reserve”  is  transferred  to 
“Retained earnings”.

xxii. Taxation

 Income tax comprises of current tax and deferred 
tax.  It  is  recognised  in  the  statement  of  profit 
and loss except to the extent it relates to an item 
recognised  directly  in  the  other  comprehensive 
income.

a) 

 Current  tax:  The  current  tax  is  based  on 
taxable  profit  for  the  year.  Taxable  profit 
differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in 
the  statement  of  profit  and  loss  because  of 
items of  income or expense that  are taxable 
or deductible in other years and items that are 
never  taxable  or  deductible.  The  Company’s 
current  tax  is  calculated  using  tax  rates  that 
have  been  enacted  or  substantively  enacted 
by the end of the reporting period.

b) 

 Deferred tax: Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are  recognised  on  temporary  differences 
between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets 
and  liabilities  in  the  financial  statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the 
computation of taxable profit.

 Deferred tax assets paid in accordance with the tax 
laws in India, which is likely to give future economic 
benefits in the form of availability of set off against 
future income tax liability.

 Deferred  income  tax  liabilities  are  recognised  for 
all taxable temporary differences except in respect 
of  taxable  temporary  differences  associated  with 
investments  in  subsidiaries,  associates  and  joint 
ventures  where  the  timing  of  the  reversal  of  the 
temporary  difference  can  be  controlled  and  it  is 
probable  that  the  temporary  difference  will  not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.

recognised 

tax  assets  are 

 Deferred 
for  all 
deductible temporary differences to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against  which 
temporary 
differences can be utilised.

those  deductible 

 Deferred  tax  assets  are  not  recognised,  when 
the  deferred  income  tax  arises  from  the  initial 
recognition  of  goodwill  or  an  asset  or  liability  in 
a  transaction  that  is  not  a  business  combination, 
affects  neither  accounting  nor  taxable  profits  or 
loss  at  the  time  of  the  transaction  and  does  not 
give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary 
differences.

 The  carrying  amount  of  deferred  tax  assets  is 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period and 
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that  sufficient  taxable  profits  will  be  available  to 
allow all or part of the asset to be utilised.

 Deferred  tax  liabilities  and  assets  are  measured 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period in which the liability is settled or the asset 
realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the end 
of the reporting period.

292

 The  measurement  of  deferred  tax  liabilities  and 
assets  reflects  the  tax  consequences  that  would 
follow  from  the  manner  in  which  the  Company 
expects,  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period,  to 
recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities.

 The  Company  offsets  deferred  income  tax  assets 
and  liabilities,  where  it  has  a  legally  enforceable 
right  to  offset  current  tax  assets  against  current 
tax liabilities, and they relate to taxes levied by the 
same taxation authority on either the same taxable 
entity, or on different taxable entities where there 
is  an  intention  to  settle  the  current  tax  liabilities 
and  assets  on  a  net  basis  or  their  tax  assets  and 
liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

 Current  and  deferred  tax  are  recognised  as  an 
expense or income in the Standalone Statement of 
Profit  and  Loss,  except  when  they  relate  to  items 
credited or debited either in Other Comprehensive 
Income or directly in equity, in which case the tax is 
also recognised in OCI or directly in equity.

xxiii. Borrowing cost

 Borrowing  costs  are  interest  and  other  costs 
(including exchange differences relating to foreign 
currency  borrowings  to  the  extent  that  they  are 
regarded  as  an  adjustment  to  interest  costs) 
incurred  in  connection  with  borrowing  of  funds. 
The  borrowing  cost  includes  interest  expense 
accrued  on  gold  on  loan  taken  from  banks. 
Borrowing  costs  attributable  to  acquisition  or 
construction  of  an  asset  which  necessarily  take  a 
substantial  period  of  time  to  get  ready  for  their 
intended use are capitalized as part of the cost of 
asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.

xxiv. Business combinations

 Business  combinations  are  accounted  for  using 
the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the aggregate of the consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value 
and  the  amount  of  any  non-controlling  interests 
in  the  acquiree.  For  each  business  combination, 
the  Company  elects  whether  to  measure  the  

Notes to standalone financial statementsfor the year ended 31st March 2025Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITED 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
interests 

in  the  acquiree  at 
non-controlling 
fair  value  or  at  the  proportionate  share  of  the 
acquiree’s  identifiable  net  assets.  Acquisition-
related costs are expensed as incurred.

 At  the  acquisition  date,  the  identifiable  assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at  their  acquisition  date  fair  values.  For  this 
purpose, the liabilities assumed include contingent 
liabilities  representing  present  obligation  and 
they  are  measured  at  their  acquisition  fair  values 
irrespective  of  the  fact  that  outflow  of  resources 
embodying economic benefits is not probable.

xxv. Provisions and contingencies

 Provisions:  A  provision  is  recognised  when  the 
Company  has  a  present  obligation  as  a  result  of 
past  events  and  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation, 
in  respect  of  which  a  reliable  estimate  can  be 
made.  The  amount  recognised  as  a  provision  is 
the  best  estimate  of  the  consideration  required 
to  settle  the  present  obligation  at  the  end  of  the 
reporting  period,  taking  into  account  the  risks 
and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  obligation. 
When  a  provision  is  measured  using  the  cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its 
carrying amount is the present value of those cash 
flows (when the effect of time value of money is 
material).

 Product warranty expenses: Product warranty costs 
are  determined  based  on  past  experience  and 
provided for in the year of sale.

 Contingent  liabilities:  A  disclosure  for  contingent 
liabilities  is  made  where  there  is  a  possible 
obligation  or  a  present  obligation  that  may 
probably  not  require  an  outflow  of  resources. 
When  there  is  a  possible  or  a  present  obligation 
where  the  likelihood  of  outflow  of  resources  is 
remote,  no  provision  or  disclosure  is  made  in  the 
financial statements.

 Provision  for  onerous  contracts.  i.e.  contracts 
where  the  expected  unavoidable  cost  of  meeting 
the  obligations  under  the  contract  exceed  the 

economic benefits expected to be received under it, 
are recognised when it is probable that an outflow 
of resources embodying economic benefits will be 
required to settle a present obligation as a result of 
an obligating event based on a reliable estimate of 
such obligation.

 Contingent  assets:  Contingent  asset 
is  not 
recognised  in  standalone  financial  statements 
since this may result in the recognition of income 
that  may  never  be  realised.  However,  when  the 
realisation  of  income  is  virtually  certain,  then 
the  related  asset  is  not  a  contingent  asset  and  is 
recognised.

 Provisions,  contingent  liabilities  and  contingent 
assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.

xxvi. Segment reporting

 Operating  segments  are  reported  in  the  manner 
consistent with the internal reporting to the chief 
operating decision maker (CODM).

 The  Company’s  primary  segments  consist  of 
Watches  and  wearables, 
Jewellery,  Eyewear, 
Corporate  and  Others,  where  ‘Others’  include 
Fragrances,  Indian  dress  wear  and  Accessories. 
Secondary information is reported geographically.

 Segment assets and liabilities include all operating 
assets  and  liabilities.  Segment  results  include 
all  related  income  and  expenditure.  Corporate 
(unallocated) 
income  and 
represents  other 
expenses which relate to the Company as a whole 
and are not allocated to segments.

xxvvii.  Cash flow statement

 Cash  flows  are  reported  using  indirect  method, 
whereby net profits before tax is adjusted for the 
effects  of  transactions  of  a  non-cash  nature  and 
any  deferrals  or  accruals  of  past  or  future  cash 
receipts  or  payments  and  items  of  income  or 
expenses  associated  with  investing  or  financing 
cash  flows.  The  cash  flows  from  regular  revenue 
generating  (operating  activities),  investing  and 
financing activities of the Company are segregated.

xxvii. Cash and cash equivalents

xxx. Dividend

 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, 
demand  deposits  with  banks,  other  short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less.

xxix. Earnings per share

 Basic  Earnings  Per  Share  (‘EPS’)  is  computed  by 
dividing  the  net  profit  attributable  to  the  equity 
shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number 
of  equity  shares  outstanding  during  the  year 
adjusted for treasury shares held. Diluted earnings 
per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  the  net  profit 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
considered for deriving basic earnings per share and 
also the weighted average number of equity shares 
that could have been issued upon conversion of all 
dilutive  potential  equity  shares.  Dilutive  potential 
equity  shares  are  deemed  converted  as  of  the 
beginning of the year, unless issued at a later date. 
In  computing  diluted  earnings  per  share,  only 
potential  equity  shares  that  are  dilutive  and  that 
either reduces earnings per share or increases loss 
per share are included.

 The  final  dividend  proposed  by  the  Board  of 
Directors  is  recognized  only  on  approval  by  the 
shareholders in the general meeting who have the 
right  to  decrease  but  not  increase  the  amount  of 
dividend recommended by the Board of Directors.

 Interim dividends are recognized on declaration by 
the Board of Directors. Final and interim dividend 
excludes dividend on treasury shares.

xxxi. Recent pronouncements

in  accordance  with 

 The  Company  has  evaluated 
its  contracts 
the 
and  arrangements 
requirements of Ind AS 117 - Insurance Contracts, 
which became effective from 1st April 2024. Based 
on this assessment, the Company has determined 
that it does not issue insurance contracts nor hold 
reinsurance contracts that fall within the scope of 
Ind AS 117.

 Accordingly,  Ind  AS  117  is  not  applicable  to  the 
Company  for  the  current  reporting  period,  and 
no  accounting  or  disclosure  requirements  under 
Ind  AS  117  have  been  applied  in  these  financial 
statements. The Company will continue to monitor 
its  contracts  to  ensure  timely  compliance  in  the 
event any arrangement falls within the scope of Ind 
AS 117 in the future.

Expected credit loss allowance

 The Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based 
on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-
looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the days the receivables are due and the 
rates as given in the provision matrix. The provision matrix at the end of reporting period as follows:

 The Supreme court of India in the month of February 2019 had passed a judgement relating to definition of wages 
under the Provident Fund Act,1952. However, considering that there are numerous interpretative issues relating to 
this judgement and in the absence of reliable measurement of the provision for the earlier periods, the Company has 
made a provision for provident fund contribution based on it’s interpretation of the said judgement. The Company 
will evaluate its position and update its provision, if required, on receiving further clarity on the subject. The Company 
does not expect any material impact of the same.

 Contributions are made to the Company’s Employees Provident Fund Trust at predetermined rates in accordance with the Fund 

rules. The interest rate payable by the Trust to the beneficiaries is as notified by the Government. The Company has an obligation 

to  make  good  the  shortfall,  if  any,  between  the  return  from  the  investments  of  the  Trust  and  the  notified  interest  rate  and 

recognises such shortfall as an expense. 

ii)  Gratuity (Funded)

 The Company makes annual contributions to The Titan Industries Gratuity Fund in accordance with The Payment of 
Gratuities Act, 1972. The scheme provides for lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while 
in  employment,  or  on  termination  of  employment  as  per  the  Company’s  Gratuity  Scheme.  Vesting  occurs  upon 
completion of five years of service.

 The plan is a defined benefit plan which is sponsored by the Company and hence it underwrites all the risks pertaining 
to the plan. In particular, there is a risk for the Company that an adverse salary growth or inadequate returns on 
underlying plan assets can result in an increase in cost of providing these benefits to employees in future. Since the 
benefits are lump sum in nature the plan is not subject to any longevity risks.

The principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

all the eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The plan is administered by the Board Nomination and 
Remuneration  Committee  (BNRC)  of  the  Company  through  a  controlled  Trust.  A  maximum  of  10,00,000  Performance 
Stock Unit (PSU) may be granted under the Plan. Each PSU granted under the plan entitles the holder to one equity share 
of the Company at an exercise price, which is approved by the BNRC.

 As per the plan, Board of Directors grants options to the employees of the Company. The vesting period of the option is 
three years from the date of grant. Options granted under the Scheme can be exercised within a period of two years from 
the date of vesting.

 BNRC granted PSUs to the eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries under the Plan. Subsequent to this grant, 
the Trust acquired shares from secondary market for the purpose of implementation of the Plan.

The movement in options issued are as below:

Particulars

Outstanding at the beginning of the year

the term of the option, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected 
dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.

 The key inputs used in Black-Scholes Model for calculating fair value of options under the scheme as on the date of grant 
are as follows:

 The weighted average remaining contractual life of the options outstanding as of 31st March 2025 was 1.24 years.

 The  fair  value  of  the  options  is  estimated  on  the  date  of  grant  using  the  Black-Scholes  Model  with  the  following 
assumptions:

 The Company has constituted a Risk Management Committee. The Company has in place a risk management framework 
to identify, evaluate business risks and challenges across the Company both at corporate level as also separately for each 
business division. These risks include market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

 The Company minimises the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The 
use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity is governed by the Company’s policies approved 
by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of such instruments consistent with the Company’s 
risk management strategy.

purposes.

34.4 Credit risk

 Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss 
to the Company. The Company has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining 
sufficient collateral, where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. Credit risk is 
managed by the Company through approved credit norms, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the 
creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. On account 
of adoption of Ind AS 109, the Company uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss. Credit risk arises 
principally from the Company’s receivables from customers. Refer note 11.2 for the disclosures for trade receivables.

 Credit risk on liquid funds, Inter Corporate Deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties 
are banks and companies with high credit-ratings assigned by credit-rating agencies.

34.5 Liquidity risk

 The Company has an approved policy to invest surplus funds from time-to-time in various short-term instruments. Security 
of funds and liquidity shall be the primary consideration while deciding on the type of investments.

 The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, 
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and 
liabilities. The Company expects to meet its other obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of maturing financial 
assets. 

The Company has following undrawn funding facilities at the end of the reporting period:

 The market risks to which the Company is exposed are price risk {refer note a) below} and foreign currency risk {refer note 
b) below}.

a) 

 Price risk:

 The Company is exposed to fluctuations in gold price (including fluctuations in foreign currency) arising on purchase/
sale of gold.

Notes to standalone financial statementsfor the year ended 31st March 2025Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITED 
 
 
 
 
 
 To manage the variability, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage the risk associated with 
gold price fluctuations relating to the inventory lying with the Company. Such derivative financial instruments are 
primarily in the nature of future commodity contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts. The risk management 
strategy against gold price fluctuation also includes procuring gold on loan basis, with a flexibility to fix price of gold 
at any time during the tenor of the loan. 

 The  use  of  such  derivative  financial  instruments  is  governed  by  the  Company’s  policies  approved  by  the  Board 
of  Directors,  which  provide  written  principles  on  the  use  of  such  instruments  consistent  with  the  Company’s  risk 
management strategy.

 As the value of the derivative instrument generally changes in response to the value of the hedged item, the economic 
relationship is established.

The following table gives details of contracts as at the end of the reporting period:

 The Company designates derivative contracts as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of 
hedged item due to movement in gold prices. Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items 
that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Therefore, there 
will be no impact of the fluctuation in the price of the gold on the Company’s profit for the period.

 Foreign currency risk management

 The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising through its sales and purchases denominated in various 
foreign currencies.

(i) 

(ii) 

 The risk management strategy on foreign currency exchange fluctuation arising on account of purchase/sale of 
gold is covered in Note 34.6 above.

 In respect of normal purchase and sale transactions denominated in foreign currency, the Company enters into 
forward foreign exchange contracts and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on 
foreign currency exposures. These contracts are measured at fair value through profit and loss.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis:

 The  Company  is  mainly  exposed  to  USD,  CHF,  HKD,  JPY,  AED,  AUD,  GBP  and  EURO  currencies.  The  Company’s 
sensitivity to a 1% increase and decrease in ` against the relevant foreign currencies is presented below:

 The  sensitivity  analysis  includes  only  outstanding  foreign  currency  denominated  monetary  items  and  adjusts  their 
translation at the period end for a 1% change in foreign currency rates. There is a decrease in profit and equity by ` 
1 crore where ` weakens by 1% against the relevant currencies. For a 1% strengthening of the ` against the relevant 
currencies there would be a comparable increase in profit and equity.

34.7  The Company’s exposure to Forward foreign exchange contracts and option contracts at the end of the reporting 

year are as follows:

 The  Company  has  15  forward  exchange  contracts  in  USD  5.16  crore  equivalent  to  `  440  crore  as  at  31st  March  2025 
(Previous year: 20 forward exchange contracts in USD 1.79 crore equivalent to ` 142 crore).

 In addition to the above, the Company has 3 Option contracts in USD 0.51 crore equivalent to ` 45 crore (Previous year: 1 
Option contract in USD 0.22 crore equivalent to ` 18 crore).

35  Capital management

 The  Company’s  objective  for  capital  management  is  to  maximise  shareholder  value,  safeguard  business  continuity  and 
support the growth of the Company. The Company determines the capital requirement based on annual operating plan 
and other strategic investment plans. The funding requirements are primarily met through equity, combination of short-
term and long-term borrowings and operating cash flows generated. Gold on loan as disclosed in the financial statements 
represents amounts due to banks for the procurement of gold under ‘Gold (Metal) loan scheme’ by the Company.

 The Company aims to manage its capital efficiently so as to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and to 
optimise returns to all its shareholders. The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

 The Company monitors the capital structure on the basis of total debt to equity ratio of the Company. The gross debt 
equity ratio is 0.60:1 as at 31st March 2025 (as at 31st March 2024 0.54:1).

 In addition, the Company has financial covenant relating to the redeemable non-convertible debentures that it has taken 
from the debenture holders to manage “Net debt to EBITDA ratio” which is maintained by the Company.

To the Members of Titan Company Limited

Basis for Opinion

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements

Opinion

We  have  audited  the  consolidated  financial  statements 
of  Titan  Company  Limited  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the 
“Holding Company”) and its subsidiaries (Holding Company 
and  its  subsidiaries  together  referred  to  as  “the  Group”) 
and  its  associate,  which  comprise  the  consolidated  balance 
sheet as at 31 March 2025, and the consolidated statement 
of  profit  and  loss  (including  other  comprehensive  income), 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated 
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes 
to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  material 
accounting  policies  and  other  explanatory 
information 
(hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  consolidated  financial 
statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according 
to  the  explanations  given  to  us,  the  aforesaid  consolidated 
financial  statements  give  the  information  required  by  the 
Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in the manner so required and 
give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting 
principles  generally  accepted  in  India,  of  the  consolidated 
state of affairs of the Group and its associate as at 31 March 
2025, of its consolidated profit and other comprehensive loss, 
consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows 
for the year then ended.

Revenue recognition

See Note 2(x) and Note 20 to consolidated financial statements

We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  the  Standards 
on  Auditing  (SAs)  specified  under  Section  143(10)  of 
the  Act.  Our  responsibilities  under  those  SAs  are  further 
described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We 
are independent of the Group and its associate in accordance 
with  the  ethical  requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code 
of  Ethics  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants 
of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have 
fulfilled  our  other  ethical  responsibilities  in  accordance  with 
these  requirements.  We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence 
obtained by us, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Key Audit Matter(s)

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the 
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These 
matters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the 
consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming 
our  opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a  separate 
opinion on these matters.

The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

The Group and its external stakeholders focus on revenue 
as a key performance indicator and considering there are 
performance  targets  (where  applicable),  this  increases 
the risk of misstatement of revenue recognized.

The Group recognizes revenue when the control of goods 
being  sold  is  transferred  to  the  customer.  A  substantial 
part of Group’s revenue relates to jewellery and watches 
which  involves  large  number  of  transactions  with  retail 
customers and sales contracts having varied contractual 
terms with distributors and franchisees.

In view of the significance of the matter, we applied the following 
audit procedures in this area, among others, to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence:

• 

• 

 We  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  accounting 
policy  for  revenue  recognition  as  per  relevant  accounting 
standard.

 We  evaluated  the  design  and  implementation  of  key 
financial  controls  and  their  operating  effectiveness  with 
respect  to  revenue  recognition  transactions  selected  on 
a  sample  basis.  These  included  general  IT  controls  and 
key  application  controls  over  the  IT  system  which  govern 
revenue  recognition,  including  access  controls,  controls 
over  program  changes  and  interfaces  between  different 
system.

353

Statutory ReportsCorporate OverviewFinancial Statements258-452103-25704-102The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

Hence,  there  is  risk  of  misstatement  of  timing  and 
existence of revenue being recognized inappropriately for 
sales made through retail outlets on cash and carry basis 
and risk of misstatement of existence of revenue in case 
of non-retail sales.

In view of the above, we have identified existence (retail 
and non-retail sales) and completeness (retail sales only) 
of revenue as a key audit matter.

• 

 We reviewed key contracts with distributors and franchisees 
selected using statistical sampling to understand terms and 
conditions particularly relating to acceptance of goods.

• 

 For retail sales:

i. 

ii. 

• 

• 

• 

• 

 in  holding  company,  we  performed  substantive 
testing using statistical sampling on sales made on a 
particular day and tested the underlying documents, 
which include tracing day sales of the retail outlet to 
the collection reports and bank statements.

(where  applicable),  we 
 in  subsidiary  company 
performed 
statistical 
testing  using 
substantive 
sampling on sales made on a particular day and tested 
the underlying documents, which include tracing day 
sales of the retail outlet to the collection reports and 
bank statements. Further, we performed procedures 
using  statistical  sampling  and  tested  cash  to  sales 
to  test  existence  and  completeness  of  revenues  for 
jewellery sold through stores.

 Additionally,  we  tested  the  underlying 
invoices 
of  the  selected  samples,  verifying  attributes  such 
as  price,  quantity,  discount,  weight,  customer 
acknowledgement and making charges.

 We  tested  credit  notes  issued  to  retail  customers 
selected  using  statistical  sampling  on  sales  return 
during the year and subsequent to the year end.

 For  sales  (other  than  retail  sales),  we  performed 
substantive testing using statistical sampling on sales 
invoices  and  tested  the  underlying  documentation 
including verification of invoices, proof of delivery and 
collections thereon.

 We tested sales transactions using statistical sampling 
on  sales  (where  applicable)  made  immediately  pre 
and  post  year  end,  agreed  the  period  of  revenue 
recognition to the underlying documents.

Inventories

See Note 2(xi) and Note 10 to consolidated financial statements

The key audit matter

How the matter was addressed in our audit

The  Group’s  inventories  primarily  comprise  high  value 
items like jewellery (gold, diamonds, gemstones etc.) and 
watches. The Group holds inventory at various locations 
including factories, stores (retail outlets) and third-party 
locations.

There  is  a  significant  risk  of  loss  of  inventory  given  the 
high value and nature of the inventory involved.

In  view  of  the  above,  we  have  identified  existence  of 
physical inventories as a key audit matter.

In view of the significance of the matter we applied the following 
audit procedures in this area, among others, to obtain sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence:

• 

 We evaluated and tested the design, implementation and 
the operating effectiveness of key controls that the Group 
has in relation to the safeguarding and physical verification 
of inventory including the appropriateness of the Group’s 
standard  operating  procedures  for  conducting,  recording 
and  reconciling  physical  verification  of  inventories  and 
tested the implementation thereof.

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

 We  evaluated  the  design,  implementation  and  operating 
effectiveness  of  general  IT  controls  and  key  application 
controls  over  the  Group’s  IT  systems  including  those 
relating to recording of inventory quantities on occurrence 
of each transaction, including access controls, controls over 
program changes, interfaces between different systems.

 For  the  locations  selected  using  statistical  sampling  we 
attended  physical  verification  of  inventory  conducted  by 
the Group and tested roll-forward/roll-backward working 
provided  by  the  management  as  at  the  year  end,  where 
applicable.  We  also  performed  physical  verification  of 
inventory  selected  using  statistical  sampling  and  checked 
reconciliation  of  inventories  as  per  physical  inventory 
verification and book records for the locations.

 We performed surprise stock count at stores selected using 
random sampling.

 We  obtained  independent  confirmations  of  inventories 
held with third parties for samples selected using statistical 
sampling.

 In holding company, we verified the purity of gold content 
using  Karatmeter  along  with  hallmarking  embossed  in 
the  jewellery  items  and  originality  of  solitaires  and  small 
diamonds using diamond tester of the samples selected as 
part of year end physical verification process, as applicable.

communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.

Other Information

The Holding Company’s Management and Board of Directors 
are  responsible  for  the  other 
information.  The  other 
information comprises the information included in the annual 
report,  but  does  not  include  the  financial  statements  and 
auditor’s report thereon. The annual report is expected to be 
made available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.

Our  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements  does 
not cover the other information and we will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified  above  when  it  becomes  available  and,  in  doing 
so,  consider  whether  the  other  information  is  materially 
inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.

When  we  read  the  annual  report,  if  we  conclude  that 
there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to

the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting 
frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application 
of  appropriate  accounting  policies;  making  judgments  and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, 
implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate  internal 
financial  controls,  that  were  operating  effectively  for 
ensuring  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  accounting 
records,  relevant  to  the  preparation  and  presentation  of 
the  consolidated  financial  statements  that  give  a  true  and 
fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose 
of  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  by 
the  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Holding 
Company, as aforesaid.

In  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the 
respective  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  of  the 
companies  included  in  the  Group  and  the  respective 
Management  and  Board  of  Directors  of  its  associate  are 
responsible  for  assessing  the  ability  of  each  company  to 
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis 
of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either 
intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included 
in  the  Group  and  the  respective  Board  of  Directors  of  its 
associate are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting 
process of each company.

Auditor’s  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the 
Consolidated Financial Statements

Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about 
whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole 
are  free  from  material  misstatement,  whether  due  to  fraud 
or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditor’s  report  that  includes  our 
opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic 
decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  consolidated 
financial statements.

As  part  of  an  audit  in  accordance  with  SAs,  we  exercise 
professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  skepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:

• 

 Identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement 
of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due 
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures 

356

• 

• 

• 

responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence 
that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis 
for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material 
misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for 
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, 
forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or 
the override of internal control.

 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to 
the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are 
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our 
opinion on whether the company has adequate internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements 
in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and 
related disclosures made by the Management and Board 
of Directors.

 Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  the  Management 
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis 
of  accounting  in  preparation  of  consolidated  financial 
statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the 
appropriateness of this assumption. lfwe conclude that 
a  material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw 
attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures 
in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such 
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our 
conclusions  are  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future 
events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Group  and  its 
associate to cease to continue as a going concern.

• 

 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content 
of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  including  the 
disclosures,  and  whether  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We  communicate  with  those  charged  with  governance  of 
the  Holding  Company  and  such  other  entities  included  in 
the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  which  we  are  the 
independent  auditors  regarding,  among  other  matters,  the 
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit 
findings,  including  any  significant  deficiencies  in  internal 
control that we identify during our audit.

We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a 
statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant  ethical 
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate 

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDwith  them  all  relationships  and  other  matters  that  may 
reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our  independence,  and 
where applicable, related safeguards.

From  the  matters  communicated  with  those  charged  with 
governance,  we  determine  those  matters  that  were  of 
most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  of  the  current  period  and  are  therefore  the  key 
audit  matters.  We  describe  these  matters  in  our  auditor’s 
report  unless  law  or  regulation  precludes  public  disclosure 
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, 
we determine that a matter should not be communicated in 
our  report  because  the  adverse  consequences  of  doing  so 
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest 
benefits of such communication.

Other Matter

a. 

 The  financial  information  of  seven  subsidiaries,  whose 
(before 
information  reflects  total  assets 
financial 
consolidation  adjustments)  of  Rs.  2,543  crore  as  at 
31  March  2025,  total  revenues  (before  consolidation 
adjustments)  of  Rs.  2,131  crore  and  net  cash  flows 
to  
(before  consolidation  adjustments)  amounting 
Rs.  31  crore  for  the  year  ended  on  that  date,  as 
considered  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements, 
have not been audited either by us or by other auditors. 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  also  include  the 
Group’s  share  of  net  profit  of  Rs.  1  crore  for  the  year 
ended 31 March 2025, as considered in the consolidated 
financial statements, in respect of one associate, whose 
financial information has not been audited by us or by 
other  auditor.  These  unaudited  financial  information 
have been furnished to us by the Management and our 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so 
far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included 
in  respect  of  these  subsidiaries  and  associate,  and  our 
report in terms of sub-section (3) of Section 143 of the 
Act  in  so  far  as  it  relates  to  the  aforesaid  subsidiaries 
and  associate,  is  based  solely  on  such  unaudited 
financial  information.  In  our  opinion  and  according 
to  the  information  and  explanations  given  to  us  by 
the  Management,  these  financial  information  are  not 
material to the Group.

 Our  opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements, 
and  our  report  on  Other  Legal  and  Regulatory 
Requirements below, is not modified in respect of this

 Based  on  our  examination  which  included  test

feature of audit trail (edit log) facility and the same 
has  operated  throughout  the  year  for  all  relevant 
transactions recorded in the respective softwares:

(i) 

(ii) 

 In  respect  of  the  Holding  Company,  the 
feature  of  audit  trail  at  the  application  as 
well as the database layer of the accounting 
software  relating  to  general  ledger,  account 
receivable  and  account  payable  was  not 
enabled  for  few  tables.  Additionally,  based 
on  our  examination,  where  the  audit  trail 
{edit log) facility was enabled and operated at 
application and database layer in the previous 
year,  the  audit  trail  has  not  been  preserved 
by  the  Company  as  per  the  statutory 
requirements for record retention.

to 

 In respect of the Holding Company and two 
subsidiary  companies,  the  feature  of  audit 
trail was not enabled at the application layer 
of the accounting software for data changes 
performed  by  users  having  privileged  access 
revenue,  accounts  payable, 
relating 
accounts 
receivable,  fixed  assets  and 
general  ledger.  Additionally,  based  on  our 
examination,  where  the  audit  trail  (edit  log) 
facility was enabled and operated at database 
layer  in  the  previous  year,  the  audit  trail 
has  not  been  preserved  by  the  Company  as 
per  the  statutory  requirements  for  record 
retention.

(iii)

absence of sufficient and appropriate reporting 
on compliance with audit trail requirements in 
the independent auditor’s report of a service 
organization  for  the  accounting  software 

(iv) 

(v) 

relating  to  revenue  of  spares  and  service 
(for  the  watches  &  wearable  division),  we 
are  unable  to  comment  whether  the  audit 
trail feature and its preservation at database 
layer as per the statutory requirements of the 
record  retention  for  the  said  software  was 
enabled  and  operated  throughout  the  year 
for all relevant transactions recorded in such 
software.

 In  respect  of  the  Holding  Company,  in 
the  absence  of  sufficient  and  appropriate 
reporting  on  compliance  with  audit  trail 
requirements  in  the  independent  auditor’s 
report  of  a  service  organization  for  the 
accounting  software  relating  to  interface 
system  between  front  end  billing  system 
and  accounting  software,  we  are  unable  to 
comment whether the audit trail feature and 
its  preservation  at  application  and  database 
layer as per the statutory requirements of the 
record  retention  for  the  said  software  was 
enabled  and  operated  throughout  the  year 
for all relevant transactions recorded in such 
software.

 In respect of one subsidiary company, in the 
absence of sufficient and appropriate reporting 
on compliance with audit trail requirements in 
the independent auditor’s report of a service 
organization  for  the  accounting  software 
relating  to  revenue,  we  are  unable  to 
comment whether the audit trail feature and 
its  preservation  at  application  and  database 
layer as per the statutory requirements of the 
record  retention  for  the  said  software  was 
enabled  and  operated  throughout  the  year 
for all relevant transactions recorded in such 
software.

 Further, where audit trail (edit log) facility was 
enabled and operated throughout the year for 
the  respective  accounting  software,  we  did 
not come across any instance of the audit trail 
feature  being  tampered  with.  Additionally, 
where  the  audit  trail  (edit  log)  facility  was 
enabled  in  the  previous  year,  the  audit  trail 
(edit  log)  has  been  preserved  by  the  Group 
as  per  the  statutory  requirements  for  record 
retention except for the instances mentioned 
above.

Report on the internal financial controls with reference to the aforesaid consolidated financial statements under 
Clause {i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Act

(Referred  to  in  paragraph  2(A)(g)  under  ‘Report  on  Other  Legal  and  Regulatory  Requirements’  section  of  our 
report of even date)

In  conjunction  with  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  of  Titan  Company  Limited  (hereinafter  referred 
to as “the Holding Company”) as of and for the year ended 
31  March  2025,  we  have  audited  the  internal  financial 
controls with reference to financial statements of the Holding 
Company  and  such  companies  incorporated  in  India  under 
the Act which are its subsidiary companies and its associate 
company, as of that date.

Management’s 
Responsibilities for Internal Financial Controls

Board 

of  Directors’ 

and 

The  respective  Company’s  Management  and  the  Board  of 
Directors  are  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining 
internal  financial  controls  based  on  the  internal  financial 
controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  criteria 
established  by  the  respective  company  considering  the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note  on  Audit  of  Internal  Financial  Controls  Over  Financial 
Reporting  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants 
of India (the “Guidance Note”). These responsibilities include 
the  design,  implementation  and  maintenance  of  adequate 
internal financial controls that were operating effectively for 
ensuring  the  orderly  and  efficient  conduct  of  its  business, 
including  adherence  to  the  respective  company’s  policies, 
the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection 
of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the 
accounting  records,  and  the  timely  preparation  of  reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements based 
on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with 
the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed 
under  Section  143(10)  of  the  Act,  to  the  extent  applicable 
to  an  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to 
financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require  that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements  and  plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether  adequate  internal  financial  controls  with  reference 
to financial statements were established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

362

Our  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit 
evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial 
controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  and  their 
operating  effectiveness.  Our  audit  of  internal  financial 
controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  included 
obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls 
with  reference  to  financial  statements,  assessing  the  risk 
that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating 
the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained  is 
sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  audit 
opinion  on  the  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to 
financial statements.

Meaning  of 
Reference to Financial Statements

Internal  Financial  Controls  with 

A  company’s  internal  financial  controls  with  reference 
to  financial  statements  is  a  process  designed  to  provide 
reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial 
reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for 
external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted 
accounting  principles.  A  company’s 
internal  financial 
controls with reference to financial statements include those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures 
of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with 
authorisations  of  management  and  directors  of  the 
company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding 
prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, 
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements.

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITEDInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls 
with Reference to Financial Statements

Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management  override 
of  controls,  material  misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud 
may  occur  and  not  be  detected.  Also,  projections  of  any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate:

Opinion

In  our  opinion,  the  Holding  Company  and  such  companies 
incorporated in India which are its subsidiary companies and 
its associate company, have, in all material respects, adequate 
internal financial controls with reference to financial statements 
and such internal financial controls were operating effectively 
as at 31 March 2025, based on the internal financial controls 
with reference to financial statements criteria established by 
such  companies  considering  the  essential  components  of 
such internal controls stated in the Guidance Note.

Other Matter

The  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  financial 
information  insofar  as  it  relates  to  one  associate  company, 
which  is  a  company  incorporated  in  India  and  included  in 
these  consolidated  financial  statements,  have  not  been 
audited either by us or by other auditor. In our opinion and 
according to the information and explanations given to us by 
the Management, such unaudited associate company is not 
material to the Holding Company.

Our opinion is not modified in respect of above matter.

Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITED1. 

 Corporate Information

its  registered  office  situated  at  3,  SIPCOT  Industrial 
Complex,  Hosur  -  635  126,  Tamil  Nadu,  India.  The 
Company  has  been  incorporated  under  the  provisions 
of  the  Indian  Companies  Act  and  its  equity  shares  are 
listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and BSE Ltd. 
in India.

2. 

 Material Accounting Policies

 This note provides a list of material accounting policies 
adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements.  These  policies  have  been  consistently 
applied  to  all  the  years  presented,  unless  otherwise 
stated. These consolidated financial statements are the 
separate financial statements of the Group.

Basis of Preparation

i. 

Statement of compliance

 The consolidated financial statements of the Group 
have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Indian 
Accounting Standard (“Ind AS”) notified under the 
Companies  (Indian  Accounting  Standards)  Rules, 
2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  read  with 
section  133  of  the  Companies  Act,  2013  (“the 
Act”) and other relevant provisions of the Act.

 The consolidated financial statements are approved 
for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on 
8th May 2025.

ii.  Basis of measurement

 The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been 
prepared  on  an  accrual  basis  under  the  historical 
cost  convention  except  for  the  following  that  are 
measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind 
AS:

a) 

b) 

 Certain  financial  assets  and 
(including derivative instruments).

liabilities 

 The  defined  benefit  asset/(liability) 
is 
recognised  as  the  present  value  of  defined 
benefit  obligation  less  fair  value  of  plan 
assets.

c) 

 Valuation  of  grants  under  Employees  Share 
Options (ESOPs).

 Historical cost is generally based on the fair value 
of  the  consideration  given  in  exchange  for  goods 
and  services.  Fair  value  is  the  price  that  would 
be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a 
liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market 
participants at the measurement date.

iii.  Current/non-current classification

 Based  on  the  time  involved  between  acquisition 
of  assets  for  processing  and  their  realisation 
in  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  the  Group  has 
identified twelve months as its operating cycle for 
determining current and non-current classification 
of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.

iv.  Rounding of amounts

 All amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial 
statements  and  notes  have  been  rounded  off  to 
rupees crore as per the requirement of Schedule III, 
unless otherwise stated. Transactions and balances 
with values below the rounding off norm adopted 
by  the  Group  have  been  reflected  as  “0”  in  the 
relevant  notes  to  these  financial  statements.  The 
Group  has  decided  to  report  all  the  amounts  in 
crore  in  lieu  of  in  lakh  as  reported  in  the  earlier 
from the current year. 

v.  Use of estimates and judgement

 The  preparation  of 
consolidated  financial 
statements  in  conformity  with  Ind  AS  requires 
management  to  make 
judgements,  estimates 
and  assumptions  that  affect  the  application  of 
accounting  policies  and  the  reported  amount  of 
assets  and  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  and 
disclosure  of  contingent  liabilities.  Such  estimates 
and  assumptions  are  based  on  management’s 
evaluation  of  relevant  facts  and  circumstances  as 
on  the  date  of  consolidated  financial  statements. 
The  actual  outcome  may  diverge  from  these 
estimates.

 Estimates  and  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  a 
periodic  basis.  Revisions  to  accounting  estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimates 
are revised and in any future periods affected.

Assumptions and estimation

 Information  about  assumptions  and  estimation 
uncertainties that have significant risk of resulting 
in  a  material  adjustment  in  the  year  ending  
31st March 2025 is included in the following notes:

Note 6 - Useful life of the Intangible assets;

Note 8 - Valuation of deferred tax assets;

Note 4, 14.2, 16 and 29 - Leases;

Note 30 - Contingent liabilities;

 Note  32  -  Measurement  of  defined  benefit 
obligations: key actuarial assumptions;

 Note  33  -  Readjustment  of  vesting  criteria 
based  on  performance  conditions  and 
estimated 
share  based 
forfeitures 
compensation expenses

in 

 Notes 35.1 and 35.2 - Fair value measurement 
of financial instruments.

vi.  Basis of consolidation

 The  consolidated  financial  statements  relate  to 
Titan  Company  Limited  and  entities  controlled  by 
the  Company.  The  control  is  achieved  when  the 
Company has power over the entity, is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement 
with the investee; and has the ability to affect the 
entity’s returns by using its power over the entity.

 The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the 
Company and its subsidiaries have been combined 

on a line by line basis by adding together the book 
values  of  like  items  of  assets,  liabilities,  income 
and  expenses,  after  fully  eliminating  intra-group 
balances,  intra-group  transactions  and  unrealised 
profit  or  losses.  These  financial  statements  are 
prepared  by  applying  uniform  accounting  policies 
in use at the Group. The excess of the Company’s 
portion of equity of the subsidiaries as at the date 
of its investment over the cost of its investment is 
treated as Capital Reserve on consolidation.

 The excess of cost to the Company of its investment 
over  the  Company’s  portion  of  equity  as  at  the 
date  of  investment  is  treated  as  Goodwill  on 
consolidation.

in  associate  and 

 Investment 
joint  venture 
are  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method 
of  accounting.  Under  the  equity  method  of 
accounting, the investments are initially recognised 
at  cost  and  adjusted  thereafter  to  recognise  the 
Group’s  share  of  the  post-acquisition  profits  or 
losses of the investee in statement of consolidated 
profit  and  loss,  and  the  Group’s  share  of  other 
comprehensive  income  of  the  investee  in  other 
comprehensive  income.  Dividends  received  or 
receivable  from  associates  and  joint  ventures  are 
recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount 
of  the  investment.  When  the  Group’s  share  of 
losses  in  an  equity-accounted  investment  equals 
or  exceeds  its  interest  in  the  entity,  including  any 
other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group 
does  not  recognise  further  losses,  unless  it  has 
incurred obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the other entity.

 Entities controlled by the Company are consolidated 
from  the  date  the  control  commences  until  the

for  equity  accounting  of  the  investment  in  the 
associate companies are unaudited.

vii.  Business combinations and goodwill

 Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition  method.  The  cost  of  an  acquisition  is 
measured  as  the  aggregate  of  the  consideration 
transferred measured at acquisition date fair value

and  the  amount  of  any  non-controlling  interests 
in  the  acquiree.  For  each  business  combination, 
the  Group  elects  whether  to  measure  the  non-
controlling  interests  in  the  acquiree  at  fair  value 
or  at  the  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are 
expensed as incurred.

 At  the  acquisition  date,  the  identifiable  assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised 
at  their  acquisition  date  fair  values.  For  this 
purpose, the liabilities assumed include contingent 
liabilities  representing  present  obligation  and

they  are  measured  at  their  acquisition  fair  values 
irrespective  of  the  fact  that  outflow  of  resources 
embodying economic benefits is not probable.

 The 
interest  of  non-controlling  shareholders 
is  initially  measured  either  at  fair  value  or  at  the 
non-controlling  interests’  proportionate  share  of 
the  acquiree’s  identifiable  net  assets.  The  choice 
of  measurement  is  made  on  an  acquisition-by-
acquisition  basis.  Subsequent  to  acquisition,  the 
carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the 
amount of those interests at initial recognition plus 
the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent 
changes in equity of subsidiaries.

 Business  combinations  arising  from  transfer  of 
interests  in  entities  that  are  under  the  common 
control  are  accounted  at  historical  cost.  The 
difference  between  any  consideration  given  and 
the aggregate historical carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities of the acquired entities are recorded 
in shareholders’ equity.

 Goodwill  is  initially  measured  at  cost,  being  the 
excess  of  the  aggregate  of  the  consideration 
transferred  and  the  amount  recognised  for  non-
controlling  interests,  and  any  previous  interest 
held,  over  the  net  identifiable  assets  acquired 
and  liabilities  assumed.  After  initial  recognition, 
goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses.

viii.  Functional and presentation currency

included 

 Items 
in  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  of  the  Group  are  measured  using  the 
currency  of  the  primary  economic  environment 
in  which  the  Group  operates  (i.e.  the  “functional 
currency”).  The  consolidated  financial  statements 
are  presented  in  Indian  Rupee,  the  national 
currency of India, which is the functional currency 
of the Group. All amounts have been rounded-off 
to the nearest crore, unless otherwise indicated.

ix.  Measurement of fair values

 Certain accounting policies and disclosures of the 
Group  require  the  measurement  of  fair  values, 
for  both  financial  and  non-financial  assets  and 
liabilities.

372

 The  Group  has  an  established  control  framework 
with respect to the measurement of fair values and 
the  valuation  team  regularly  reviews  significant 
unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments.

 Fair values are categorised into different levels in a 
fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the 
valuation techniques as follows:

- 

- 

- 

 Level  1:  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities.

 Level  2:  inputs  other  than  quoted  prices 
included in Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

 Level  3:  inputs  for  the  asset  or  liability  that 
are  not  based  on  observable  market  data 
(unobservable inputs).

 When  measuring  the  fair  value  of  an  asset  or  a 
liability,  the  Group  uses  observable  market  data 
as  far  as  possible.  If  the  inputs  used  to  measure 
the  fair  value  of  an  asset  or  a  liability  fall  into  a 
different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the 
fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety 
in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the 
lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  entire 
measurement.

 Further  information  about  the  assumptions  made 
in  the  measuring  fair  values  is  included  in  the 
following notes:

- 

- 

 Note 5.1 - Investment property

Note 35 - Financial instruments.

x.  Revenue and other income recognition

 The  Group  recognises  revenue  when  the  control 
of goods being sold is transferred to the customer 
and  when  there  are  no  longer  any  unfulfilled 
obligations.  The  performance  obligations  in  the 
contracts  are  fulfilled  based  on  various  customer 
terms  including  at  the  time  of  delivery  of  goods, 
dispatch  or  upon  customer  acceptance  based 
on  various  distribution  channels.  The  Group  has 
generally  concluded  that  it  is  the  principal  in  its

the goods or services before transferring them to 
the customer.

transaction price, which is the consideration, 
net of customer incentives, discounts, variable 
considerations, payments made to customers, 
other  similar  charges,  as  specified  in  the 
contract  with  the  customer.  Additionally, 
revenue  excludes 
from 
customers,  which  are  subsequently  remitted 
to  governmental  authorities.  Accruals  for 
returns  are  estimated  (using  the  most  likely 
method)  based  on  accumulated  experience 
and agreements with customers.

 Revenues  from  fixed  price  contracts  are 
recognised on the percentage of completion

costs incurred for work performed up to the 
reporting  date  bear  to  the  estimated  total 
contract  costs.  Contract  revenue  earned  in 
excess  of  billing  has  been  reflected  under 
“Other  current  assets”  and  billing  in  excess 
of contract revenue has been reflected under 
“Other  current  liabilities”  in  the  balance 
sheet. Full provision is made for any loss in the 
year  in  which  it  is  first  foreseen.  Liquidated 
damages/penalties are provided for as per the 
contract  terms  wherever  there  is  a  delayed 
delivery attributable to the Group.

contracts. Contract assets are classified as unbilled 
receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when 
there  is  unconditional  right  to  receive  cash,  and 
only passage of time is required, as per contractual 
terms. Other contract assets are classified as other 
assets. Unearned and deferred revenue (“contract 
liability”)  is  recognised  when  there  is  billings  in 
excess of revenues. Advances received for services 
are  reported  as  liabilities  until  all  conditions  for 
revenue recognition are met.

Barter Transactions

 The  Group  has  entered  into  barter  arrangements 
with  certain  media  and  advertising  agencies, 
where  products  are  provided  in  exchange  for 
advertisement  services.  These  transactions  are 
recognised in accordance with Ind AS 115- Revenue 
from  contracts  with  customers  considering  the 
following:

• 

• 

• 

 The contracts were enforceable, approved by 
both parties, and had commercial substance

 The  Group  transferred  control  of  goods  to 
the  counterparty,  satisfying  performance 
obligations

 Revenue  was  recognised  based  on  the  fair 
value of the merchandise provided

Customer loyalty programmes

 The Group has a customer loyalty programme for 
selected customers. The Group grants credit points 
to  those  customers  as  part  of  a  sales  transaction 
which  allows  them  to  accumulate  and  redeem 
those credit points. The consideration is allocated 
between  the  loyalty  programme  and  the  goods 
based  on  their  relative  standalone  selling  prices. 
The  credit  points  have  been  deferred  and  will  be 
recognised as revenue when the reward points are 
redeemed or lapsed.

income from investments is recognised when 
the Group’s right to receive the payment has 
been established i.e., either when the dividend 
is declared or when shareholders approve the 
dividend in case of equity investments.

 For all financial instruments measured at amortised 
cost, interest income is recorded using the effective 
interest  rate  (EIR),  which  is  the  rate  that  exactly 
discounts  the  estimated  future  cash  payments 
or  receipts  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial 
instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate,

judgements 

in 

revenue 

 The  Group’s  contracts  with  customers  could 
include  promises  to  transfer  multiple  goods  to  a 
customer. The Group assesses the goods promised 
in  a  contract  and  identifies  distinct  performance 
obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct 
performance  obligation  involves  judgement  to 
determine  the  deliverables  and  the  ability  of  the 
customer  to  benefit  independently  from  such 
deliverables.

 Judgement  is  also  required  to  determine  the 
transaction price for the contract. The transaction 
price could be either a fixed amount of customer 
consideration  or  variable  consideration  with 
elements  such  as  volume  discounts,  performance 
bonuses,  price  concessions  and  incentives.  The 
transaction  price  is  also  adjusted  for  the  effects 
of  the  time  value  of  money  if  the  contract 
includes  a  significant  financing  component.  Any 
consideration payable to the customer is adjusted 
to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for 
a distinct good from the customer. The estimated 
amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the 
transaction price only to the extent that it is highly 
probable that a significant reversal in the amount 
of  cumulative  revenue  recognised  will  not  occur 
and  is  reassessed  at  the  end  of  each  reporting 
period.

standalone 

selling  price 

 The  Group  uses  judgement  to  determine  an 
for  a 
appropriate 
performance  obligation.  The  Group  allocates  the 
transaction  price  to  each  performance  obligation 
on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price 
of  each  distinct  good  or  service  promised  in  the 
contract.  Where  standalone  selling  price  is  not

 The  Group  uses  the  percentage-of-completion 
method in accounting for its fixed-price contracts. 
Use  of  the  percentage-of-completion  method 
requires the Group to estimate the costs expended 
to  date  as  a  proportion  of  the  total  costs  to  be 
expended.  Costs  expended  have  been  used  to 
measure progress towards completion as there is a 
direct relationship between input and productivity.

 Commission income is generally recognised when 
the related sale is executed as per the terms of the 
agreement.

 The  Group  has  determined  that  the  revenues 
as  disclosed  in  Note  20  are  disaggregated  into 
categories  that  depict  how  the  nature,  amount, 
timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows 
are affected by economic factors.

Inventories

 Inventories [other than quantities of gold for which 
the price is yet to be determined with the suppliers 
(Unfixed gold) or where hedge contracts have been 
entered into for quantities of gold and accounted 
for as fair value hedge] are stated at the lower of 
cost  and  net  realisable  value  determined  on  an 
item-by-item basis. Cost is determined as follows:

a)  Gold is valued on first-in-first-out basis

b) 

c) 

 Stores  and  spares,  loose  tools  and  raw 
materials  are  valued  on  a  moving  weighted 
average rate

 Work-in-progress  and  finished  goods  (other 
than gold) are valued on full absorption cost 
method based on the moving average cost of 
production

 Traded  goods  are  valued  on  a  moving

 Cost  comprises  all  costs  of  purchase  including 
duties  and  taxes  (other  than  those  subsequently 
inwards 
the  Group), 
recoverable  by 
and  other  expenditure  directly  attributable  to 
acquisition.  Work-in-progress  and  finished  goods 
include  appropriate  proportion  of  overheads  and, 
where applicable, other taxes.

freight 

 Unfixed gold and quantities of gold covered under 
fair value hedge is valued at gold prices prevailing 
on  the  period  closing  date.  Gold  quantities  other 
than unfixed and covered through fair value hedge 
is  valued  on  first-in-first-out  basis.  Net  realisable 
value  represents  the  estimated  selling  price  for 
inventories less estimated costs of completion and 
costs necessary to make the sale. The net realisable 
value  of  work-in-progress  is  determined  with 
reference  to  the  selling  prices  of  related  finished 
goods.  Raw  materials,  components  and  other 
supplies held for use in the production of finished 
products are not written down below cost except 
in  cases  when  a  decline  in  the  price  of  materials 
indicates that the cost of the finished products shall 
exceed the net realisable value. The comparison of 
cost and net realisable value is made on an item-
by-item basis.

xii.  Property, Plant and Equipment

a)   Recognition and measurement:

 Land  and  buildings  held  for  use  in  the 
production  or  supply  of  goods  or  services, 
or  for  administrative  purposes,  are  stated 
at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and 
accumulated 
losses.  Freehold 
land is not depreciated.

impairment 

 Property,  plant  and  equipment  are  carried 
at  cost 
less  accumulated  depreciation 
and  impairment  losses,  if  any.  The  cost  of 
property,  plant  and  equipment  comprises 
its  purchase  price/acquisition  cost,  net 
of  any  trade  discounts  and  rebates,  any 
import  duties  and  other  taxes  (other  than 
those  subsequently  recoverable  from  the 
tax  authorities),  any  directly  attributable 
expenditure  on  making  the  asset  ready  for 

its  intended  use,  other  incidental  expenses 
and 
interest  on  borrowings  attributable 
to  acquisition  of  qualifying  property,  plant 
and  equipment  up  to  the  date  the  asset  is 
ready  for  its  intended  use.  Machine  spare 
parts  are  recognised  in  accordance  with  this 
Ind  AS  when  they  meet  the  definition  of 
property,  plant  and  equipment,  otherwise, 
inventory. 
such 
Subsequent  expenditure  on  property,  plant 
and equipment after its purchase/completion 
is capitalised only if such expenditure results 
in an increase in the future benefits from such 
asset beyond its previously assessed standard 
of performance.

items  are  classified  as 

 The estimated useful life of the tangible assets 
and the useful life are reviewed at the end of 
the  each  financial  year  and  the  depreciation 
period  is  revised  to  reflect  the  changed 
pattern, if any.

 An  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment 
is  derecognised  upon  disposal  or  when  no 
future economic benefits are expected to arise 
from continued use of the asset. Any gain or 
loss  arising  on  the  disposal  or  retirement  of 
an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is 
determined  as  the  difference  between  the 
sales  proceeds  and  the  carrying  amount  of 
the asset and is recognised in the statement 
of consolidated profit and loss.

b)   Depreciation

 Depreciable  amount  for  assets  is  the  cost  of 
an  asset,  or  other  substituted  for  cost,  less 
its  estimated  residual  value.  Depreciation 
is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  estimated 
useful  lives  using  the  straight  line  method 
and is generally recognised in the statement 
of  consolidated  profit  and  loss.  Depreciation 
for  assets  purchased/sold  during  the  year  is 
proportionately  charged  from/upto  the  date 
of disposal. However, leasehold improvements 
are  depreciated  on  a  straight-line  method 
over the shorter of their respective useful lives 
or the tenure of the lease arrangement. Free 
hold land is not depreciated.

 Based 
and 
consequent advice, the management believes 
that  its  estimates  of  useful  lives  as  given 
above  represents  the  period  over  which  the 
management expects to use these assets.

 When  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant 
and  equipment  have  different  useful  lives, 
they  are  accounted  for  as  separate  items 
(major  components)  of  property,  plant  and 
equipment. Repairs and maintenance costs are 
recognised  in  the  statement  of  consolidated 
profit and loss when incurred.

 The cost and related accumulated depreciation 
are eliminated from the consolidated financial 
statements  upon  sale  or  disposition  of  the 
asset  and  the  resultant  gains  or  losses  are 
recognised  in  the  statement  of  consolidated 
profit and loss.

 Advance  paid  towards  acquisition  of  fixed 
assets  outstanding  at  each  consolidated

properties are measured initially at cost, including 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
investment properties are measured in accordance 
with Ind AS 16’s requirements for cost model.

 An  investment  property  is  derecognised  upon 
disposal  or  when  the  investment  property  is 
permanently  withdrawn  from  use  and  no  future 
economic benefits are expected from the disposal. 
Any  gain  or  loss  arising  on  derecognition  of  the 
property (calculated as the difference between the 
net  disposal  proceeds  and  the  carrying  amount 
of  the  asset)  is  included  in  the  statement  of 
consolidated profit and loss in the period in which 
the property is derecognised.

 The investment property includes only land held by 
the Group and accordingly no amortisation of the 
investment  property  is  recorded  in  the  statement 
of consolidated profit and loss.

 The  fair  values  of  the  investment  property  are 
disclosed in the notes. Fair values is determined by 
an independent valuer who holds a recognised and 
relevant  professional  qualification  and  has  recent 
experience  in  the  location  and  category  of  the 
investment property being valued.

 The cost of Investment property at 1st April 2016, 
the  Group’s  date  of  transition  to  Ind  AS,  was 
determined  with  reference  to  its  carrying  value 
recognised  as  per  the  previous  GAAP  (deemed 
cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.

xiv.  Leases

c)  Short-term leases:

 The Group assesses at contract inception whether 
a contract is, or contains, a lease i.e., if the contract 
conveys the right to control the use of an identified 
asset for a period in exchange of consideration.

  Group as a Lessee

 The  Group  applies  a  single  recognition  and 
measurement  approach  for  all  leases  except  for 
short-term  leases.  The  Group  recognises  lease 
liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use 
assets representing the right to use the underlying 
assets.  The  nature  of  expenses  related  to  those 
leases  has  changed  from  lease  rent  in  previous 
periods  to  (i)  amortisation  for  the  right-to-use 
asset, and (ii) interest accrued on lease liability.

a)  Right-of-use assets:

 Right-of-use  assets  are  measured  at  cost 
comprising the following:

i) 

 the  amount  of  the  initial  measurement 
of lease liability

ii) 

any initial direct costs

iii) 

restoration costs

 Right-of-use  assets  are  depreciated  over  the 
lease term on a straight-line basis.

b)  Lease Liabilities:

 Lease liabilities are measured at present value 
of following components:

i) 

ii) 

 fixed payments less any lease incentives 
receivable

 amounts expected to be payable by the 
Group under residual value guarantee

rate  used 

 Incremental  borrowing 
for 
discounting  has  been  determined  by  taking 
the  interest  rates  obtained  from  financial 
institutions  for  borrowing  the  similar  value 
of  right  of  use  assets  for  similar  tenure.  The 
rates  will  be  reassessed  on  a  yearly  basis  at 
the  beginning  of  each  accounting  period  to 
reflect changes in financial conditions.

 The  Group  applies  the  short-term  lease 
recognition  exemption  to 
its  short-term 
lease  contracts  (i.e.  those  leases  that  have 
a  lease  term  of  12  months  or  less  from  the 
commencement  date  and  do  not  contain  a 
purchase option). Lease payments on a short-
term  leases  are  recognised  as  expense  on  a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.

d)  Variable payments:

 Variable lease payments that depend on sales 
are  recognised  in  the  Statement  of  profit  or 
loss in the period in which the condition that 
triggers those payments occurs.

e)  Modification/termination of lease:

 The  lease  liability  is  measured  at  amortised 
cost using the effective interest method. It is 
remeasured when there is a change in future 
lease  payments  arising  from  a  change  in  an 
index or rate, if there is a change in the estimate 
of the amount expected to be payable under a 
residual value guarantee, if the Group changes 
its  assessment  of  whether  it  will  exercise  a 
purchase, extension or termination option or 
if  there  is  a  revised  in-substance  fixed  lease 
payment.  A  corresponding  adjustment  is 
made to the carrying amount of the right-of-
use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the 
carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has 
been reduced to zero.

  Group as a Lessor:

 In case of sub-leasing, where the Group, being 
the  original  lessee  and  intermediate  lessor, 
grants a right to use the underlying asset to 
a third party, the head lease is recognised as 
lease  liability  and  sub-lease  is  recognised  as 
lease receivables in the Balance Sheet of the 
Group.  Interest  expense  is  charged  on  the 
lease liability and interest income is recognised 
on lease receivables in the statement of profit 
or loss.

Intangible assets

initial 

 Intangible assets acquired separately are measured 
on 
recognition  at  cost.  Subsequent 
expenditure  is  capitalised  only  when  it  increases 
the  future  economic  benefits  attributable  to  the 
asset will flow to the Group and the cost of asset 
can be measured reliably. All other expenditure is 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

 Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment. Intangible assets are 
amortised  over  their  respective  estimated  useful 
lives on a straight line basis, from the date that they 
are available for use. The estimated useful life of an 
identifiable intangible assets is based on a number 
of  factors  including  the  effects  of  obsolescence, 
demand, 
competition  and  other  economic 
factors  (such  as  the  stability  of  the  industry  and 
known  technological  advances)  and  the  level  of 
maintenance  expenditures  required  to  obtain  the 
expected future cash flows from the asset.

 The estimated useful lives of intangible assets are 
as follows:

Software -  License period or 5 years, whichever is 

lower.

Intellectual properties - 5 years

Patents - 5 years

Brand - Infinite period.

 The  estimated  useful  life  of  the  intangible  assets 
and  the  amortisation  period  are  reviewed  at  the 
end  of  each  financial  year  and  the  amortisation 
period is revised to reflect the changed pattern, if 
any.

 The  cost  of  Intangible  assets  at  1st  April  2016, 
the  Group’s  date  of  transition  to  Ind  AS,  was 
determined  with  reference  to  its  carrying  value 
recognised  as  per  the  previous  GAAP  (deemed 
cost), as at the date of transition to Ind AS.

xvi.  Impairment

Impairment of financial assets:

 The  Group  recognises  loss  allowances  using  the 
expected  credit  loss  (ECL)  model  for  the  financial 
assets which are not fair valued through profit or 

378

loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables with no 
significant financing component is measured at an 
amount equal to life time ECL. For all other financial 
assets, expected credit losses are  measured at an 
amount  equal  to  the  12-month  ECL,  unless  there 
has  been  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  from 
initial recognition in which case those are measured 
at lifetime ECL.

 The  Group  evaluates  a  significant  increase  in 
credit  risk  based  on  quantitative  and  qualitative 
indicators such as overdue status, deterioration in 
credit  rating,  and  adverse  changes  in  business  or 
economic conditions.

 The amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) 
that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the 
reporting  date  to  the  amount  that  is  required  to 
be recognised is recognised as an impairment gain 
or loss in the statement of consolidated profit and 
loss.

Impairment of non-financial assets:

 At  the  end  of  each  reporting  period,  the  Group 
reviews  the  carrying  amounts  of  its  tangible  and 
intangible  assets  to  determine  whether  there  is 
any  indication  that  those  assets  have  suffered  an 
impairment  loss.  If  any  such  indication  exists,  the 
recoverable  amount  of  the  assets  is  estimated  in 
order  to  determine  the  extent  of  the  impairment 
loss  (if  any).  When  it  is  not  possible  to  estimate 
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the 
Group  estimates  the  recoverable  amount  of  the 
cash-generating  unit  to  which  the  assets  are  also 
allocated  to  individual  cash-generating  units,  or 
otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group 
of  cash-generating  units  for  which  a  reasonable 
and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less 
costs  of  disposal  and  value  in  use.  In  assessing 
value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are 
discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre-
tax  discount  rate  that  reflects  current  market 
assessments  of  the  time  value  of  money  and  the 
risks  specific  to  the  asset  for  which  estimates  of 
future cash flows have not been adjusted.

 If  the  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  (or  cash 
generating  unit)  is  estimated  to  be  less  than 
its  carrying  amount,  the  carrying  amount  of 
the  asset  (or  cash  generating  unit)  is  reduced 
to  its  recoverable  amount.  An  impairment  loss 
is  recognised  immediately  in  the  statement  of 
consolidated profit and loss.

 When  an  impairment  loss  subsequently  reverses, 
(or  cash 
the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset 
generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate 
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased 
carrying  amount  does  not  exceed  the  carrying 
amount that would have been determined had no 
impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or 
cash  generating  unit)  in  prior  years.  A  reversal  of 
impairment  loss  is  recognised  immediately  in  the 
statement of consolidated profit and loss.

Impairment of Infinite intangible assets:

 A cash generating unit to which infinite intangible 
assets has been allocated is tested for impairment 
annually,  or  more  frequently  when  there  is  an 
indication  that  the  unit  may  be  impaired.  If  the 
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is 
less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss 
is  allocated  first  to  reduce  the  carrying  amount 
of  any  infinite  intangible  assets  allocated  to  the 
unit  and  then  to  the  other  assets  of  the  unit  pro 
rata  based  on  the  carrying  amount  of  each  asset 
in  the  unit.  Any  impairment  loss  for  such  asset  is 
recognised in the statement of consolidated profit 
and  loss.  An  impairment  loss  recognised  of  such 
asset is not reversed in subsequent periods.

xvii. Foreign currencies

a)  Transactions and balances:

 In  preparing 
the  consolidated  financial 
statements  of  the  Group,  transactions  in 
currencies  other  than  the  entity’s  functional 
currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at 
the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of 
the transaction. At the end of each reporting 
period,  monetary 
in 
foreign  currency  are  translated  at  the  rates 
prevailing  at  that  date.  Non-monetary  items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost 
in a foreign currency are not translated.

items  denominated 

 Exchange differences on monetary items are 
recognised  in  the  statement  of  consolidated 
profit  and  loss  in  the  period  in  which  they 
arise  except  for  exchange  differences  on 
transactions  designated  as  cash  flow  hedge 
(refer note xxii(b)).

b)  Foreign operations:

 For  the  purpose  of  presenting  consolidated 
financial statements, the assets and liabilities 
of  the  Group’s  foreign  operations  that  have 
a  functional  currency  other  than  Indian 
rupees are translated into Indian rupees using 
exchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  reporting 
date. Income and expense items are translated 
at the average exchange rates for the period. 
Exchange  differences  arising,  if  any,  are 
recognised  in  other  comprehensive  income 
and  held  in  foreign  currency  translation 
reserve (FCTR), a component of equity, except 
to the extent that the translation difference is 
allocated to non-controlling interest. When a 
foreign operation is disposed off, the relevant 
amount  recognised  in  FCTR  is  transferred 
to  the  statement  of  consolidated  profit  and 
loss as part of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill  and  fair  value  adjustments  arising 
on the acquisition of a foreign operation are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
operation and translated at the exchange rate 
prevailing at the reporting date.

xviii. Borrowing cost

 Borrowing  costs  are  interest  and  other  costs 
(including exchange differences relating to foreign 
currency  borrowings  to  the  extent  that  they  are 
regarded  as  an  adjustment  to  interest  costs) 
incurred  in  connection  with  borrowing  of  funds. 
The  borrowing  cost  includes  interest  expense 
accrued  on  gold  on  loan  taken  from  banks. 
Borrowing  costs  attributable  to  acquisition  or 
construction  of  an  asset  which  necessarily  take  a 
substantial  period  of  time  to  get  ready  for  their 
intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of 
asset. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an 
expense in the period in which they are incurred.

xix.  Employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits

 All short-term employee benefits such as salaries, 
wages, bonus, special awards and medical benefits 
which fall within 12 months of the period in which 
the employee renders related services which entitles 
them to avail such benefits and non-accumulating 
compensated  absences  are  recognised  on  an 
undiscounted basis and charged to the statement 
of consolidated profit and loss.

 A  liability  is  recognised  for  the  amount  expected 
to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-
sharing plans, if the Group has a present legal or 
constructive  obligation  to  pay  this  amount  as  a 
result of past service provided by the employee and 
the obligation can be estimated reliably.

  Defined contribution plan

 The  Group’s  contributions  to  the  Superannuation 
Fund  which  is  managed  by  a  Trust  and  Pension 
Fund  administered  by  Regional  Provident  Fund 
Commissioner and Group’s contribution to National 
pension Scheme are charged as an expense based 
on the amount of contribution required to be made 
and when services are rendered by the employees.

  Defined benefit plan

 The  contribution  to  the  Group’s  Gratuity  Trust 
and  liability  towards  pension  of  retired  managing 
directors  are  provided  using  the  projected  unit 
credit  method,  with  actuarial  valuations  being 
carried  out  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  period. 
Remeasurement,  comprising  actuarial  gains  and 
losses is reflected immediately in the consolidated 
balance sheet with charge or credit recognised in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which 
they  occur.  Remeasurement  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive  income  is  reflected  in  retained 
earnings and is not reclassified to the statement of 
consolidated profit and loss.

 The  contribution  to  the  Group’s  Provident  Fund 
Trust  is  made  at  predetermined  rates  and  is 
charged  as  an  expense  based  on  the  amount 
of  contribution  required  to  be  made  and  when 
services are rendered by the employees.

Compensated absences

 Compensated absences which are not expected to 
occur  within  twelve  months  after  the  end  of  the 
period in which the employee renders the related 
services are recognised as an actuarially determined 
liability at the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the consolidated balance sheet date.

xx.  Taxation

 Income 
tax  and 
tax  comprises  of  current 
deferred  tax.  It  is  recognised  in  the  statement  of 
consolidated  profit  and  loss  except  to  the  extent 
that it relates to an item recognised directly in the 
other comprehensive income.

a) 

b) 

 Current  tax:  The  current  tax  is  based  on 
taxable  profit  for  the  year.  Taxable  profit 
differs from ‘profit before tax’ as reported in 
the statement of consolidated profit and loss 
because  of  items  of  income  or  expense  that 
are  taxable  or  deductible  in  other  years  and 
items  that  are  never  taxable  or  deductible. 
The Group’s current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.

 Deferred tax: Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are  recognised  on  temporary  differences 
between  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets 
and  liabilities  in  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  and  the  corresponding  tax  bases 
used in the computation of taxable profit.

 Deferred  tax  assets  paid  in  accordance  with 
the  tax  laws  in  India,  which  is  likely  to  give 
future  economic  benefits  in  the  form  of 
availability of set off against future income tax 
liability.

 Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised 
for  all  taxable  temporary  differences  except 
in  respect  of  taxable  temporary  differences 
associated  with  investments  in  subsidiaries, 
associates and joint ventures where the timing 
of  the  reversal  of  the  temporary  difference 
can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary  difference  will  not  reverse  in  the 
foreseeable future.

 Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  for  all 
deductible temporary differences to the extent 
that  it  is  probable  that  taxable  profits  will 
be  available  against  which  those  deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.

 Deferred tax assets are not recognised, when 
the  deferred  income  tax  arises  from  the 
initial  recognition  of  goodwill  or  an  asset  or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination  and  affects  neither  accounting 
nor taxable profits or loss at the time of the 
transaction.

 The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is 
reviewed at the end of each reporting period 
and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be 
utilised.

 Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the  period  in  which  the  liability  is  settled  or 
the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax 
laws) that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the end of the reporting period.

 The  measurement  of  deferred  tax  liabilities 
and assets reflects the tax consequences that 
would  follow  from  the  manner  in  which  the 
Group  expects,  at  the  end  of  the  reporting 
period,  to  recover  or  settle  the  carrying 
amount of its assets and liabilities.

income  tax 
 The  Group  offsets  deferred 
assets  and  liabilities,  where  it  has  a  legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities, and they relate to 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority on 
either the same taxable entity, or on different 
taxable entities where there is an intention to 
settle the current tax liabilities and assets on a 
net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will 
be realised simultaneously.

 Current  and  deferred  tax  are  recognised 
as  an  expense  or  income  in  the  Standalone 
Statement  of  Profit  and  Loss,  except  when 

they relate to items credited or debited either 
in Other Comprehensive Income or directly in 
equity, in which case the tax is also recognised 
in OCI or directly in equity

xxi.   Discontinued  Operations  and  non-current 

assets held for sale

 Discontinued  operation  is  a  component  of  the 
Group  that  has  been  disposed  of  or  classified  as 
held  for  sale.  Non-current  assets  and  disposal 
groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying 
amount  is  intended  to  be  recovered  principally 
through a sale (rather than through continuing use) 
when the asset (or disposal group) is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition subject only 
to terms that are usual and customary for sale of 
such asset (or disposal group) and the sale is highly 
probable and is expected to qualify for recognition 
as a completed sale within one year from the date 
of  classification.  Non-current  assets  and  disposal 
groups classified as held for sale are measured at 
lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell.

xxii. Financial instruments

Recognition of financial assets:

 Financial  assets  and  financial 
liabilities  are 
recognised  when  the  Group  becomes  a  party  to 
the contractual provisions of the instruments.

 A  financial  asset  (unless  it  is  a  trade  receivable 
without  a  significant  financing  component)  or 
financial  liability  is  initially  measured  at  fair  value 
plus. Transaction costs that are directly attributable 
to  financial  assets  and  liabilities  [other  than 
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
through  profit  and  loss  (FVTPL)]  are  added  to  or 
deducted from the fair value of the financial assets 
or  liabilities,  as  appropriate  on  initial  recognition. 
Transaction costs directly attributable to acquisition 
of financial assets or liabilities measured at FVTPL 
are  recognised  immediately  in  the  statement  of 
profit and loss.

 A  trade  receivable  without  a  significant  financing 
component is initially measured at the transaction 
price.

 All  regular  way  purchases  or  sales  of  financial 
assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade 
date  basis.  Regular  way  purchases  or  sales  are 
purchases  or  sales  of  financial  assets  that  require 
delivery of assets within the time frame established 
by regulation or convention in market place.

 All  recognised  financial  assets  are  subsequently 
measured in their entirety at either amortised cost 
or  fair  value,  depending  on  the  classification  of 
financial assets.

  A)  Financial Assets

Classification of financial assets:

 On  initial  recognition,  a  financial  asset  is 
classified at

(i)  Amortised cost

(ii) 

 Fair value through other comprehensive 
income (FVOCI)

(iii) 

 Fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL)

 Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent 
to their initial recognition, except if and in the 
period the group changes its business model 
for managing financial assets.

i) 

 Financial assets at amortised cost:

 A  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortised 
cost  if  both  of  the  following  conditions  are 
met:

a) 

b) 

 the  financial  asset  is  held  within  a 
business  model  whose  objective  is  to 
hold  financial  assets  in  order  to  collect 
contractual cash flows and

 the  contractual  terms  of  the  financial 
asset  give  rise  on  specified  dates  to 
cash  flows  that  are  solely  payments 
of  principal  and  interest  (SPPI)  on  the 
principal amount outstanding.

 In  case  of  financial  assets  classified  and 
measured  at  amortised  cost,  any  interest 
income, foreign exchange gains or losses and 
impairment  are  recognised  in  the  Statement 
of Profit and Loss.

382

Effective interest method:

 The  effective  interest  method  is  a  method 
of  calculating  the  amortised  cost  of  a  debt 
instrument  and  of  allocating  interest  income 
over the relevant period. The effective interest 
rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future 
cash  receipts  through  the  expected  life  of 
the debt instrument, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on 
initial recognition.

 Income is recognised on an effective interest 
basis  for  debt  instruments  other  than  those 
financial assets. Interest income is recognised 
in profit or loss and is included in the “Other 
income” line item.

ii)   Investments in equity instruments at Fair 
Value  Through  Other  Comprehensive 
Income (FVTOCI)

investments  are 

 On  initial  recognition,  the  Group  can  make 
an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-
instrument  basis)  to  present  the  subsequent 
changes in fair value either in the statement 
of  consolidated  profit  and  loss  or  in  other 
comprehensive  income  pertaining  to  equity 
instruments.  This  election  is  not  permitted 
if  the  equity  investment  is  held  for  trading. 
These  elected 
initially 
measured  at  fair  value  plus  transaction 
costs.  Subsequently,  they  are  measured  at 
fair  value  with  gains  and  losses  arising  from 
changes  in  fair  value  recognised  in  other 
comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in 
the  ‘Reserve  for  equity  instruments  through 
other comprehensive income’. The cumulative 
gain or loss is not reclassified to the statement 
of consolidated profit and loss on disposal of 
the investment.

A financial asset is held for trading if:

- 

- 

 it  has  been  acquired  principally  for  the 
purpose of selling it in the near term; or

iii)   Investments  in  equity  instruments  at 

FVTPL

 A  financial  asset  that  meets  the  amortised 
cost  criteria  may  be  designated  as  at  FVTPL 
upon  initial  recognition  if  such  designation 
eliminates  or 
a 
measurement  or  recognition  inconsistency 
that  would  arise  from  measuring  assets  or 
liabilities  or  recognising  the  gains  and  losses 
on them on different bases.

significantly 

reduces 

 Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair 
value at the end of each reporting period, with 
any gains or losses arising on remeasurement 
recognised  in  the  statement  of  consolidated 
profit and loss. The net gain or loss recognised 
in  the  statement  of  consolidated  profit  and 
loss  incorporates  any  dividend  or  interest 
earned on the financial asset and is included 
in the ‘Other income’ line item. Dividend on 
financial assets at FVTPL is recognised when 
the  Group’s  right  to  receive  the  dividend  is 
established, it is probable that the economic 
benefits  associated  with  the  dividend  will 
flow  to  the  entity,  the  dividend  does  not 
represent a recovery of part of the cost of the 
investment  and  the  amount  of  dividend  can 
be measured reliably.

 Subsequent measurement and gains and 
losses

 Financial  assets  at  FVTPL:  These  assets  are 
subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains 
and losses, including any interest or dividend 
income, are recognised in profit or loss.

 Financial assets at amortised cost: These assets 
are subsequently measured at amortised cost 
using  the  effective  interest  method.  Any 
interest  income,  foreign  exchange  gains  or 
losses  and  impairment  are  recognised  in  the 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

 Financial  assets  at  FVTOCI:  Currently,  the 
Group has not elected to present subsequent 
changes in investments in equity instruments 
in OCI. Accordingly, the same are considered 
as investments measured at FVTPL.

 Derecognition of financial assets

A financial asset is derecognised only when

- 

- 

 The  Group  has  transferred  the  rights 
to receive cash flows from the financial 
asset or

 retains  the  contractual  rights  to  receive 
the cash flows of the financial asset, but 
assumes a contractual obligation to pay 
the cash flows to one or more recipients.

 When  the  entity  has  transferred  an  asset, 
the  Group  evaluates  whether 
it  has 
transferred substantially all risks and rewards 
of  ownership  of  the  financial  asset.  In  such 
cases, the financial asset is derecognised.

 Whether  the  entity  has  not  transferred 
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership 
of the financial asset, the financial asset is not 
derecognised.

 Where  the  entity  has  neither  transferred  a 
financial asset nor retains substantially all risks 
and  rewards  of  ownership  of  the  financial 
asset, the financial asset is derecognised if the 
Group has not retained control of the financial 
asset.  When  the  Group  retains  control  of 
the  financial  asset,  the  asset  is  continued  to 
be  recognised  to  the  extent  of  continuing 
involvement in the financial asset.

 The  Group  has  applied  derecognition 
requirements of financial assets and financial 
liabilities  prospectively 
transactions 
occurring on or after the transition date of Ind 
AS.

for 

 Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition 
of the financial asset is recognised in the profit

 For 
currency  denominated 
financial  assets  measured  at  amortised 
cost and FVTPL, the exchange differences 
are  recognised  in  the  statement  of 
consolidated  profit  and  loss  except  for 
those  which  are  designated  as  hedging 
instruments in a hedging relationship.

 For the purposes of recognising foreign 
exchange gains and losses, FVTOCI debt 
instruments  are  treated  as  financial 
assets  measured  at  amortised  cost. 
Thus,  the  exchange  differences  on  the 
amortised  cost  are  recognised  in  the 
statement of consolidated profit and loss 
and  other  changes  in  the  fair  value  of 
FVTOCI  financial  assets  are  recognised 
in other comprehensive income.

  Offsetting

 Financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are 
offset  and  the  net  amount  presented  in  the 
balance  sheet  when,  and  only  when,  the 
Group currently has a legally enforceable right 
to  set  off  the  amounts  and  it  intends  either 
to settle them on a net basis or to realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

B)   Financial liabilities: classification, 
subsequent measurement and 
derecognition:

Equity instruments:

 An  equity  instrument  is  any  contract  that 
evidences  a  residual  interest  in  the  assets  of 
an  entity  after  deducting  all  of  its  liabilities. 
Equity  instruments  issued  by  a  group  entity 
are recognised at the proceeds received, net 
of direct issue costs.

and  commitments  issued  by  the  Group  to 
provide  a  loan  at  below-market  interest  rate 
are measured in accordance with the specific 
accounting policies set out below.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL

 A  financial  liability  is  classified  as  FVTPL  if 
it  is  classified  as  held-for-trading,  or  it  is  a 
derivative or it is designated as such in initial 
recognition.

 Financial  liabilities  at  FVTPL  are  measured  at 
fair value and net gains and losses, including 
any  interest  expense,  are  recognised  in  the 
statement of consolidated profit and loss. The 
net gain or loss recognised in the statement 
of  consolidated  profit  and  loss  incorporates 
any  interest  paid  on  the  financial  liability 
and  is  included  in  the  ‘Other  income/Other 
expenses’ line item.

 Financial  liabilities  that  are  not  held-for-
trading  and  are  not  designated  as  at  FVTPL 
are measured at amortised cost at the end of 
subsequent accounting periods. The carrying 
amounts  of  financial 
liabilities  that  are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost are 
determined  based  on  the  effective  interest 
method.

 The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating  the  amortised  cost  of  a  financial 
liability  and  of  allocating  interest  expense 
over  the  relevant  period.  The  effective 
interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated  future  cash  payments  through 
the  expected  life  of  the  financial  liability,  or 
(where  appropriate)  a  shorter  period,  to  the 
net carrying amount on initial recognition.

Foreign exchange gains and losses:

 For  financial  liabilities  that  are  denominated 
in  a  foreign  currency  and  are  measured  at 
amortised  cost  at  the  end  of  each  reporting 
period, the foreign exchange gains and losses 
are determined based on the amortised cost 
of the instruments and are recognised in the 
statement of consolidated profit and loss.

that  are  measured  as  at  FVTPL,  the  foreign 
exchange  component  forms  part  of  the  fair 
value gains or losses and is recognised in the 
statement of consolidated profit and loss.

  Derecognition of financial liabilities:

 The  Group  derecognises  financial  liabilities 
when, and only when, the Group’s obligations 
are discharged, cancelled or have expired. An 
exchange  with  a  lender  of  debt  instruments 
with substantially different terms is accounted 
for  as  an  extinguishment  of  the  original 
financial liability and the recognition of a new 
financial liability.

 The  Group  has  applied  derecognition 
requirements of financial assets and financial 
liabilities  prospectively 
transactions 
occurring on or after the transition date of Ind 
AS.

xxiii. Derivative financial instruments

a)   Derivative instruments not designated as 
Cash flow hedges/Fair value hedge:

 The Group enters into a variety of derivative 
financial instruments to manage its exposure 
to  foreign  exchange  rate  risks,  including 
foreign  exchange  forward  contracts,  future 
contracts and options.

 Derivatives  are  initially  recognised  at  fair 
value at the date the derivative contracts are 
entered into and are subsequently remeasured 
to their fair value at the end of each reporting 
period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised 
in  the  statement  of  consolidated  profit 
and  loss  immediately  unless  the  derivative 
is  designated  and  effective  as  a  hedging 
instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition  in  profit  or  loss  depends  on  the 
nature  of  the  hedging  relationship  and  the 
nature of the hedged item.

b)   Fair Value Hedge:

 The  Group  adopted  fair  value  hedge  for 
the  derivative  contracts  entered  into  and 
designated  derivative  contracts  or  non-
derivative  financial 
liabilities  as  hedging 
instruments to mitigate the risk of change in 
fair  value  of  hedged  item  due  to  movement 
in  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates  and 
commodity  prices.  Changes  in  the  fair  value 
of  hedging  instruments  and  hedged  items 
that  are  designated  and  qualify  as  fair  value 
hedges are recorded in the Statement of Profit 
and Loss with an adjustment to the carrying 
value of the hedged item. Hedge accounting 
is discontinued when the Group revokes the 
hedge relationship, the hedging instrument or 
hedged item expires or is sold, terminated, or 
exercised  or  no  longer  meets  the  criteria  for 
hedge accounting.

 The  Group  designates  derivative  contracts 
as  hedging  instruments  to  mitigate  the  risk 
of  change  in  fair  value  of  hedged  item  i.e. 
fixed gold inventory due to movement in gold 
prices.

 The Group also designated the trade payables 
pertaining to gold taken on loan from banks 
(‘unfixed  gold’)  as  a  fair  value  hedge  to  the 
corresponding  gold  inventory  purchased  on 
loan.

 The Group designates non derivative financial 
liabilities  as  hedging  instruments  to  mitigate 
the  risk  of  change  in  fair  value  of  hedged 
item  due  to  movement  in  interest  rates, 
foreign  exchange 
rates  and  commodity 
prices.  Changes  in  the  fair  value  of  hedging 
instruments  and  hedged 
items  that  are 
designated  and  qualify  as  fair  value  hedges 
are recorded in the statement of consolidated 
profit  and  loss  with  an  adjustment  to  the 
carrying value of the hedged item.

xxiv. Provisions and contingencies

 Provisions:  A  provision  is  recognised  when  the 
Group  has  a  present  obligation  as  a  result  of 
past  events  and  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation, 
in respect of which a reliable estimate can be made.

 The  amount  recognised  as  a  provision  is  the 
best  estimate  of  the  consideration  required  to 
settle  the  present  obligation  at  the  end  of  the 
reporting  period,  taking  into  account  the  risks 
and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  obligation. 
When  a  provision  is  measured  using  the  cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its 
carrying amount is the present value of those cash 
flows (when the effect of time value of money is 
material).

 Product warranty expenses: Product warranty costs 
are  determined  based  on  past  experience  and 
provided for in the year of sale.

 Contingent  liabilities:  A  disclosure  for  contingent 
liabilities  is  made  where  there  is  a  possible 
obligation  or  a  present  obligation  that  may 
probably  not  require  an  outflow  of  resources. 
When  there  is  a  possible  or  a  present  obligation 
where  the  likelihood  of  outflow  of  resources  is 
remote,  no  provision  or  disclosure  is  made  in  the 
consolidated financial statements.

 Provision  for  onerous  contracts.  i.e.  contracts 
where  the  expected  unavoidable  cost  of  meeting 
the  obligations  under  the  contract  exceed  the 
economic benefits expected to be received under 
it, are recognised.

 Contingent  assets:  Contingent  asset 
is  not 
recognised  in  standalone  financial  statements 
since this may result in the recognition of income 
that  may  never  be  realised.  However,  when  the 
realisation  of  income  is  virtually  certain,  then 
the  related  asset  is  not  a  contingent  asset  and  is 
recognised.

 Provisions,  contingent  liabilities  and  contingent 
assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date.

 When  it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources 
embodying  economic  benefits  will  be  required 
to  settle  a  present  obligation  as  a  result  of  an 
obligating  event  based  on  a  reliable  estimate  of 
such obligation.

xxv. Segment reporting

 Operating  segments  are  reported  in  the  manner 
consistent with the internal reporting to the chief 
operating decision maker (CODM).

 The Group’s primary segments consist of Watches 
and  wearables,  Jewellery,  Eyewear,  Corporate 
and  Others,  where  ‘Others’  include  Aerospace 
&  Defence,  Automation  Solutions,  Fragrances, 
Accessories  and  Indian  dress  wear.  Secondary 
information is reported geographically.

 Segment assets and liabilities include all operating 
assets  and  liabilities.  Segment  results  include 
all  related  income  and  expenditure.  Corporate 
(unallocated) 
income  and 
represents  other 
expenses which relate to the Group as a whole and 
are not allocated to segments.

xxvi. Consolidated cash flow statement

 Consolidated cash flows are reported using indirect 
method, whereby net profits before tax is adjusted 
for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature 
and  any  deferrals  or  accruals  of  past  or  future 
cash receipts or payments and items of income or

expenses  associated  with  investing  or  financing 
cash  flows.  The  consolidated  cash  flows  from 
regular  revenue  generating  (operating  activities), 
investing and financing activities of the Group are 
segregated.

xxvii. Cash and cash equivalents

 Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, 
demand  deposits  with  banks,  other  short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of 
three months or less.

xxviii. Earnings per share

 Basic  Earnings  Per  Share  (‘EPS’)  is  computed  by 
dividing  the  net  profit  attributable  to  the  equity 
shareholders  by  the  weighted  average  number 
of  equity  shares  outstanding  during  the  year 
adjusted for treasury shares held. Diluted earnings 
per  share  is  computed  by  dividing  the  net  profit 
by the weighted average number of equity shares 
considered for deriving basic earnings per share and 
also the weighted average number of equity shares 
that could have been issued upon conversion of all 
dilutive  potential  equity  shares.  Dilutive  potential 
equity  shares  are  deemed  converted  as  of  the 
beginning of the year, unless issued at a later date. 
In  computing  diluted  earnings  per  share,  only 
potential  equity  shares  that  are  dilutive  and  that 
either reduces earnings per share or increases loss 
per share are included.

xxix. Share based payments

 The  stock  options  granted  to  employees  in  terms 
of the Company’s Performance Based Stock Units 
Scheme,  are  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the 
options  as  on  the  grant  date.  The  fair  value  of 
the  options  is  accounted  as  employee  expense  is 
expensed  over  the  period  from  the  modification 
date  till  the  vesting  date  over  the  vesting  period 
on a straight-line basis (net of forfeitures) based on 
the fulfilment of the probability of the performance 
conditions and employee’s requisite service period. 
The amount recognised as expense in each year is 
arrived at based on the number of grants expected 
to  vest  and  if  a  grant  lapses  after  the  vesting 
period,  the  cumulative  amount  recognised  as 

expense  in  respect  of  such  grant  is  transferred  to 
the retained earnings within equity. The fair value 
of the stock options granted to employees of the 
Company’s subsidiaries is accounted as a recharge 
and recovered from the subsidiary.

 On  modification  of  an  equity  settled  award,  the 
Company  re-estimates  the  fair  value  of  stock 
option  as  on  the  date  of  modification  and  any 
incremental  expense  is  expensed  over  the  period 
from the modification date till the vesting date.

 The  share-based  payment  equivalent  to  the  fair 
value  as  on  the  date  of  grant  of  employee  stock 
options  granted  to  key  managerial  personnel  is 
disclosed as a related party transaction in the year 
of grant.

 The  dilutive  effect  of  outstanding  options  is 
reflected  as  additional  share  dilution 
in  the 
computation of diluted earnings per share.

 The  Company  estimates  the  fair  value  of  stock 
options using option pricing model.

xxx. Treasury share reserve

 The  Company’s  equity  shares  held  by  a  trust, 
which  is  consolidated  as  a  part  of  the  Company, 
are  classified  as  Treasury  shares.  Treasury  shares 
are  carried  at  acquisition  cost  and  presented 
as  a  deduction  from  total  equity  as  “Treasury 
share  reserve”.  As  and  when  treasury  shares 
are  transferred  to  employees  on  exercise  after 
satisfaction of the vesting conditions, the balance 
lying  in  “Treasury  share  reserve”  is  transferred  to 
“Retained earnings”.

xxxi. Dividend

 The  final  dividend  proposed  by  the  Board  of 
Directors  is  recognised  only  on  approval  by  the 
shareholders in the general meeting who have the 
right  to  decrease  but  not  increase  the  amount  of 
dividend recommended by the Board of Directors. 
Interim dividends are recognised on declaration by 
the Board of Directors. Final and interim dividend 
excludes dividend on treasury shares.

xxxii. Government Grants

xxxiii. Recent pronouncements

 Government grants are recognised where there is 
reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, 
and all attached conditions will be complied with. 
When  the  grant  relates  to  an  expense  item,  it  is 
recognised  as  income  on  a  systematic  basis  over 
the  periods  that  the  related  costs,  for  which  it  is 
intended to compensate, are expensed. When the 
grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income 
in equal amounts over the expected useful life of 
the related asset.

 When  the  Company  receives  grants  of  non-
monetary  assets,  the  asset  and  the  grant  are 
recorded  at  fair  value  amounts  and  released  to 
profit  or  loss  over  the  expected  useful  life  in  a 
pattern  of  consumption  of  the  benefit  of  the 
underlying asset i.e. by equal annual instalments.

 The  Group  has  evaluated 
its  contracts  and 
arrangements in accordance with the requirements 
of Ind AS 117 - Insurance Contracts, which became 
effective  from  1st  April  2024.  Based  on  this 
assessment, the Group has determined that it does 
not issue insurance contracts nor hold reinsurance 
contracts that fall within the scope of Ind AS 117.

 Accordingly,  Ind  AS  117  is  not  applicable  to  the 
Group  for  the  current  reporting  period,  and  no 
accounting  or  disclosure  requirements  under 
Ind  AS  117  have  been  applied  in  these  financial 
statements. The Group will continue to monitor its 
contracts to ensure timely compliance in the event 
any  arrangement  falls  within  the  scope  of  Ind  AS 
117 in the future.

 The amendment does not have a material impact 
on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the Company’s procedure for determining the recoverable 
value of such assets. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a CGU representing the lowest level/group 
of CGUs within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and which is not higher than the 
Company’s operating segment. The goodwill has been entirely allocated to the CaratLane CGU.

The recoverable amount of the CaratLane CGU is determined on the basis of value-in-use (VIU). The VIU of the CGU is determined 
based on discounted cash flow projections. Key assumptions on which the Company has based its determination of VIU include 
estimated cash flows, terminal value and discount rates.

Value-in-use is calculated using after tax assumptions. The use of after tax assumptions does not result in a value-in-use that 
is materially different from the value-in-use that would result if the calculation was performed using before tax assumptions.

The  key  assumptions  used  in  the  estimation  of  the  recoverable  amount  are  set  out  below.  The  value  assigned  to  the  key 
assumptions represent management’s assessment of future trends in the relevant industries and have been based on historical 
data from both external and internal sources.

a) 

Terminal value growth rate 6% (previous year 6%)

b)  Discount rate post tax 13% (previous year 13%)

The discount rate is a post-tax measure estimated based on the historical industry average weighted-average cost of capital, 
with a possible debt leveraging applicable to the region at a market interest rate applicable to the respective region.

The cash flow projections include specific estimates for ten years and a terminal growth rate thereafter. The terminal growth 
rate has been determined based on management’s estimate of the long-term compound annual EBITDA growth rate, consistent 
with  the  assumptions  that  a  market  participant  would  make.  Revenue  growth  has  been  projected  taking  into  account  the 
average growth levels experienced over the past years and the estimated sales volume and price growth for the coming years. 
It has been assumed that the sales price would increase in line with forecast inflation over the next ten years.

An analysis of the calculation’s sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (revenue growth, operating margin, discount rate 
and  long-term  growth  rate)  based  on  reasonably  probable  assumptions,  did  not  identify  any  probable  scenarios  where  the 
CGU’s/group of CGU’s recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.

The  cash  flows  beyond  5  years  have  been  extrapolated  assuming  6%  long-term  growth  rates  which  are  consistent.  Any 
reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating unit. As a result of the updated analysis, management did not identify impairment for this CGU.

(c)  Expected credit loss allowance

 The Group has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a 
provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking 
information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the days the receivables are due and the rates 
as given in the provision matrix. The provision matrix at the end of reporting period is as follows:

(relating to miscellaneous claims)

h) 

i) 

 The above amounts are based on the notice of demand or the Assessment Orders or notification by the relevant 
authorities, as the case may be, and the Group is contesting these claims with the respective authorities. Outflows, 
if any, arising out of these claims would depend on the outcome of the decisions of the appellate authorities and the 
Company’s rights for future appeals before the judiciary. No reimbursements are expected.

 The Supreme court of India in the month of February 2019 had passed a judgement relating to definition of wages 
under  the  Provident  Fund  Act,1952.  However,  considering  that  there  are  numerous  interpretative  issues  relating 
to this judgement and in the absence of reliable measurement of the provision for the earlier periods, the Group 
has made a provision for provident fund contribution based on its interpretation of the said judgement, wherever 
applicable. The Group will evaluate its position and update its provision, if required, on receiving further clarity on the 
subject. The Group does not expect any material impact of the same.

 CaratLane Trading Private Limited (a subsidiary of Titan Company Limited) had received a Show Cause Notice (‘SCN’) 
dated 28th March 2022, from the office of the Directorate of Enforcement, Government of India (‘DOE’) alleging that 
it had received Foreign Direct Investment (‘FDI’) during the years 2011 to 2014 in violation of FEMA Rules as Foreign 
Direct Investment in single-brand retail was not permitted then. CaratLane, had approached a former Chief Justice of 
India who had opined that it was not in violation of the FEMA rules as at the relevant period, it was only in the B2B 
sector and was not in retail trade. Based on the legal opinion and its assessment of transactions for the years under 
consideration, CaratLane management believes that no provision is required in the financial statements for the year 
ended 31st March 2025. The Management would re-evaluate this position in subsequent period, based on outcome 
of proceedings before the Hon’ble Court and DOE.

 The Company has entered into various contracts with vendors and contractors for the acquisition of plant and machinery 
of capital nature amounting to ` 224 crore, which are pending to be executed (Previous year: ` 256 crore)

 * Contributions are made to the Group’s Employees Provident Fund Trust at predetermined rates in accordance with the Fund rules. The 

interest rate payable by the Trust to the beneficiaries is as notified by the Government. The Group has an obligation to make good the 

shortfall, if any, between the return from the investments of the Trust and the notified interest rate and recognises such shortfall as an 

expense.

i)  Gratuity (Funded)

 The Group makes annual contributions to The Titan Industries Gratuity Fund in accordance with Payment of Gratuity 
Act, 1972. The scheme provides for lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment, 
or on termination of employment as per the Group’s Gratuity Scheme. Vesting occurs upon completion of five years 
of service.

The gratuity benefit of the CaratLane is non-funded.

 The plan is defined benefit plan which is sponsored by the Group and hence it underwrites all the risks pertaining to 
the plan. In particular, there is a risk for the Group that an adverse salary growth or inadequate returns on underlying 
plan assets can result in an increase in cost of providing these benefits to employees in future. Since the benefits are 
lump sum in nature the plan is not subject to any longevity risks.

The principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

years from the date of grant. Options granted under the Scheme can be exercised within a period of two years from the 
date of vesting.

Fair value measurement

 The  fair  value  at  grant  date  is  determined  using  the  Black-Scholes  Model  which  takes  into  account  the  exercise  price, 
the term of the option, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected 
dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.

 The key inputs used in Black-Scholes Model for calculating fair value of options under the scheme as on the date of grant 
are as follows:

 The weighted average remaining contractual life of the options outstanding as of 31st March 2025 was 1.24 years.

 The fair value of the options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton Model with the following 
assumptions:

No. of options granted
Vesting period
Dividend yield (%)
Volatility rate (%)

35.3 Financial risk management objective

 The Group has constituted a Risk Management Committee. The group has in place a Risk management framework to 
identify, evaluate business risks and challenges across the Companies both at corporate level as also separately for each 
business division. These risks include market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.

 The Group minimises the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The use 
of  derivative  financial  instruments  and  investment  of  excess  liquidity  is  governed  by  the  Group’s  policies  approved  by 
the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of such instruments consistent with the Group’s risk 
management strategy.

 The  Group  does  not  enter  into  or  trade  financial  instruments  including  derivative  financial  instruments,  for  speculative 
purposes.

35.4 Credit risk

 Credit risk refers to the risk that the counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to 
the  Group.  The  Group  has  adopted  a  policy  of  only  dealing  with  creditworthy  counterparties  and  obtaining  sufficient 
collateral, where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. Credit risk is managed by 
the Group through approved credit norms, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of 
customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business. On account of adoption of Ind AS 109, 
the Group uses expected credit loss model to assess the impairment loss. Credit risk arises principally from the Group’s 
receivables from customers. Refer Note 11.2 for the disclosures for trade receivables.

 Credit risk on liquid funds, Inter Corporate deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties 
are banks and Companies with high credit-ratings assigned by credit-rating agencies.

35.5 Liquidity risk

 The Group has an approved policy to invest surplus funds from time-to-time in various short-term instruments. Security of 
funds and liquidity shall be the primary consideration while deciding on the type of investments.

 The  Group  manages  liquidity  risk  by  maintaining  adequate  reserves,  banking  facilities  and  reserve  borrowing  facilities, 
by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and 
liabilities. The group expects to meet its other obligations from operating cash flows and proceeds of maturing financial 
assets. 

The Group has following undrawn funding facilities at the end of the reporting period:

 The market risks to which the Group is exposed are price risk {Refer note (a) below} and foreign currency risk {Refer note 
(b) below}.

a) 

 Price risk:

 The Group is exposed to fluctuations in gold price (including fluctuations in foreign currency) arising on purchase/sale 
of gold.

 To manage the variability in cash flows, the Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage the risk 
associated with gold price fluctuations relating to the inventory lying with the Company. Such derivative financial 
instruments are primarily in the nature of future commodity contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts. The 
risk management strategy against gold price fluctuation also includes procuring gold on loan basis, with a flexibility 
to fix price of gold at any time during the tenor of the loan. 

440

Notes to Consolidated financial statementsfor the year ended 31st March 2025Annual Report 2024-25TITAN COMPANY LIMITED 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The use of such derivative financial instruments is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, 
which provide written principles on the use of such instruments consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy.

 As the value of the derivative instrument generally changes in response to the value of the hedged item, the economic 
relationship is established.
